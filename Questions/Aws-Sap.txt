Question3: You are running a successful multitier web application on AWS and your marketing department has asked you to add a reporting tier to the application. The reporting tier will aggregate and publish status reports every 30 minutes from user-generated information that is being stored in your web application s database. You are currently running a Multi-AZ RDS MySQL instance for the database tier. You also have implemented Elasticache as a database caching layer between the application tier and database tier. Please select the answer that will allow you to successfully implement the reporting tier with as little impact as possible to your database.
 A.  Continually send transaction logs from your master database to an S3 bucket and generate the reports off  the S3 bucket using S3 byte range requests.
 B.  Generate the reports by querying the synchronously replicated standby RDS MySQL instance maintained  through Multi-AZ.
 C.  Launch a RDS Read Replica connected to your Multi AZ master database and generate reports by querying  the Read Replica. 
 D.  Generate the reports by querying the ElastiCache database caching tier.
answers: C.
Explanation: Amazon RDS allows you to use read replicas with Multi-AZ deployments. In Multi-AZ deployments for MySQL, Oracle, SQL Server, and PostgreSQL, the data in your primary DB Instance is synchronously replicated to to a standby instance in a different Availability Zone (AZ). Because of their synchronous replication, Multi-AZ deployments for these engines offer greater data durability benefits than do read replicas. (In all Amazon RDS for Aurora deployments, your data is automatically replicated across 3 Availability Zones.) You can use Multi-AZ deployments and read replicas in conjunction to enjoy the complementary benefits of each. You can simply specify that a given Multi-AZ deployment is the source DB Instance for your Read replicas. That way you gain both the data durability and availability benefits of Multi-AZ deployments and the read scaling benefits of read replicas. Note that for Multi-AZ deployments, you have the option to create your read replica in an AZ other than that of the primary and the standby for even more redundancy. You can identify the AZ corresponding to your standby by looking at the “Secondary Zone” field of your DB Instance in the AWS Management Console.

Question4: A company is running a batch analysis every hour on their main transactional DB, running on an RDS MySQL instance, to populate their central Data Warehouse running on Redshift. During the execution of the batch, their transactional applications are very slow. When the batch completes they need to update the top management dashboard with the new dat
 A.  The dashboard is produced by another system running on-premises that is currently started when a  manually-sent email notifies that an update is required. The on-premises system cannot be modified  because is managed by another team.  How would you optimize this scenario to solve performance issues and automate the process as much as  possible?

Question6: Which is a valid Amazon Resource name (ARN) for IAM?
 A.  aws:iam::123456789012:instance-profile/Webserver
 B.  arn:aws:iam::123456789012:instance-profile/Webserver 
 C.  123456789012:aws:iam::instance-profile/Webserver
 D.  arn:aws:iam::123456789012::instance-profile/Webserver
answers: B.
Explanation: IAM ARNs Most resources have a friendly name (for example, a user named Bob or a group named Developers). However, the access policy language requires you to specify the resource or resources using the following Amazon Resource Name (ARN) format. arn:aws:service:region:account:resource Where: service identifies the AWS product. For IAM resources, this is always iam. region is the region the resource resides in. For IAM resources, this is always left blank. account is the AWS account ID with no hyphens (for example, 123456789012). resource is the portion that identifies the specific resource by name. You can use ARNs in IAM for users (IAM and federated), groups, roles, policies, instance profiles, virtual MFA devices, and server certificates. The following table shows the ARN format for each and an example. The region portion of the ARN is blank because IAM resources are global.

Question7: You are responsible for a web application that consists of an Elastic Load Balancing (ELB) load balancer in front of an Auto Scaling group of Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (EC2) instances.

Question16: Your company hosts a social media website for storing and sharing documents. The web application allows user to upload large files while resuming and pausing the upload as needed. Currently, files are uploaded to your PHP front end backed by Elastic load Balancing and an autoscaling fleet of Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (EC2) instances that scale upon average of bytes received (NetworkIn). After a file has been uploaded, it is copied to Amazon Simple Storage Service (S3). Amazon EC2 instances use an AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) role that allows Amazon S3 uploads. Over the last six months, your user base and scale have increased significantly, forcing you to increase the Auto Scaling group’s Max parameter a few times. Your CFO is concerned about rising costs and has asked you to adjust the architecture where needed to better optimize costs. Which architecture change could you introduce to reduce costs and still keep your web application secure and scalable?
 A.  Replace the Auto Scaling launch configuration to include c3.8xlarge instances; those instances can  potentially yield a network throuthput of 10gbps.

Question26: Refer to the architecture diagram above of a batch processing solution using Simple Queue Service (SQS) to set up a message queue between EC2 instances which are used as batch processors Cloud Watch monitors the number of Job requests (queued messages) and an Auto Scaling group adds or deletes batch servers automatically based on parameters set in Cloud Watch alarms. You can use this architecture to implement which of the following features in a cost effective and efficient manner?
 A.  Reduce the overall lime for executing jobs through parallel processing by allowing a busy EC2 instance that  receives a message to pass it to the next instance in a daisy-chain setup.
 B.  Implement fault tolerance against EC2 instance failure since messages would remain in SQS and worn can  continue with recovery of EC2 instances implement fault tolerance against SQS failure by backing up  messages to S3.
 C.  Implement message passing between EC2 instances within a batch by exchanging messages through  SQS.
 D.  Coordinate number of EC2 instances with number of job requests automatically thus Improving cost  effectiveness. 
 E.  Handle high priority jobs before lower priority jobs by assigning a priority metadata field to SQS messages.
answers: D.
Explanation: There are cases where a large number of batch jobs may need processing, and where the jobs may need to be re-prioritized. For example, one such case is one where there are differences between different levels of services for unpaid users versus subscriber users (such as the time until publication) in services enabling, for example, presentation files to be uploaded for publication from a web browser. When the user uploads a presentation file, the conversion processes, for example, for publication are performed as batch processes on the system side, and the file is published after the conversion. Is it then necessary to be able to assign the level of priority to the batch processes for each type of subscriber? Explanation of the Cloud Solution/Pattern A queue is used in controlling batch jobs. The queue need only be provided with priority numbers. Job requests are controlled by the queue, and the job requests in the queue are processed by a batch server. In Cloud computing, a highly reliable queue is provided as a service, which you can use to structure a highly reliable batch system with ease. You may prepare multiple queues depending on priority levels, with job requests put into the queues depending on their priority levels, to apply prioritization to batch processes. The performance (number) of batch servers corresponding to a queue must be in accordance with the priority level thereof. Implementation In AWS, the queue service is the Simple Queue Service (SQS). Multiple SQS queues may be prepared to prepare queues for individual priority levels (with a priority queue and a secondary queue). Moreover, you may also use the message Delayed Send function to delay process execution. Use SQS to prepare multiple queues for the individual priority levels. Place those processes to be executed immediately (job requests) in the high priority queue. Prepare numbers of batch servers, for processing the job requests of the queues, depending on the priority levels. Queues have a message “Delayed Send” function. You can use this to delay the time for starting a process. Configuration Benefits You can increase or decrease the number of servers for processing jobs to change automatically the processing speeds of the priority queues and secondary queues. You can handle performance and service requirements through merely increasing or decreasing the number of EC2 instances used in job processing. Even if an EC2 were to fail, the messages (jobs) would remain in the queue service, enabling processing to be continued immediately upon recovery of the EC2 instance, producing a system that is robust to failure. Cautions Depending on the balance between the number of EC2 instances for performing the processes and the number of messages that are queued, there may be cases where processing in the secondary queue may be completed first, so you need to monitor the processing speeds in the primary queue and the secondary queue.

Question29: Company B is launching a new game app for mobile devices. Users will log into the game using their existing social media account to streamline data capture. Company B would like to directly save player data and scoring information from the mobile app to a DynamoDS table named Score Data When a user saves their game the progress data will be stored to the Game state S3 bucket. What is the best approach for storing data to DynamoDB and S3?
 A.  Use an EC2 Instance that is launched with an EC2 role providing access to the Score Data DynamoDB  table and the GameState S3 bucket that communicates with the mobile app via web services.
 B.  Use temporary security credentials that assume a role providing access to the Score Data DynamoDB table  and the Game State S3 bucket using web identity federation. 
 C.  Use Login with Amazon allowing users to sign in with an Amazon account providing the mobile app with  access to the Score Data DynamoDB table and the Game State S3 bucket.
 D.  Use an IAM user with access credentials assigned a role providing access to the Score Data DynamoDB  table and the Game State S3 bucket for distribution with the mobile app.
answers: B.
Explanation: Web Identity Federation Imagine that you are creating a mobile app that accesses AWS resources, such as a game that runs on a mobile device and stores player and score information using Amazon S3 and DynamoDB. When you write such an app, you’ll make requests to AWS services that must be signed with an AWS access key. However, we strongly recommend that you do not embed or distribute long-term AWS credentials withapps that a user downloads to a device, even in an encrypted store. Instead, build your app so that it requests temporary AWS security credentials dynamically when needed using web identity federation. The supplied temporary credentials map to an AWS role that has only the permissions needed to perform the tasks required by the mobile app. With web identity federation, you don’t need to create custom sign-in code or manage your own user identities. Instead, users of your app can sign in using a well-known identity provider (IdP) —such as Login with Amazon, Facebook, Google, or any other OpenID Connect (OIDC)-compatible IdP, receive an authentication token, and then exchange that token for temporary security credentials in AWS that map to an IAM role with permissions to use the resources in your AWS account. Using an IdP helps you keep your AWS account secure, because you don’t have to embed and distribute long-term security credentials with your application. For most scenarios, we recommend that you use Amazon Cognito because it acts as an identity broker and does much of the federation work for you. For details, see the following section, Using Amazon Cognito for Mobile Apps. If you don’t use Amazon Cognito, then you must write code that interacts with a web IdP (Login with Amazon, Facebook, Google, or any other OIDC-compatible IdP) and then calls the AssumeRoleWithWebIdentity API to trade the authentication token you get from those IdPs for AWS temporary security credentials. If you have already used this approach for existing apps, you can continue to use it. Using Amazon Cognito for Mobile Apps The preferred way to use web identity federation is to use Amazon Cognito. For example, Adele the developer is building a game for a mobile device where user data such as scores and profiles is stored in Amazon S3 and Amazon DynamoDB. Adele could also store this data locally on the device and use Amazon Cognito to keep it synchronized across devices. She knows that for security and maintenance reasons, long-term AWS security credentials should not be distributed with the game. She also knows that the game might have a large number of users. For all of these reasons, she does not want to create new user identities in IAM for each player. Instead, she builds the game so that users can sign in using an identity that they’ve already established with a well-known identity provider, such as Login with Amazon, Facebook, Google, or any OpenID Connect (OIDC)- compatible identity provider. Her game can take advantage of the authentication mechanism from one of these providers to validate the user’s identity. To enable the mobile app to access her AWS resources, Adele first registers for a developer ID with her chosen IdPs. She also configures the application with each of these providers. In her AWS account that contains the Amazon S3 bucket and DynamoDB table for the game, Adele uses Amazon Cognito to create IAM roles that precisely define permissions that the game needs. If she is using an OIDC IdP, she also creates an IAM OIDC identity provider entity to establish trust between her AWS account and the IdP. In the app’s code, Adele calls the sign-in interface for the IdP that she configured previously. The IdP handles all the details of letting the user sign in, and the app gets an OAuth access token or OIDC ID token from the provider. Adele’s app can trade this authentication information for a set of temporary security credentials that consist of an AWS access key ID, a secret access key, and a session token. The app can then use these credentials to access web services offered by AWS. The app is limited to the permissions that are defined in the role that it assumes. The following figure shows a simplified flow for how this might work, using Login with Amazon as the IdP. For Step 2, the app can also use Facebook, Google, or any OIDC-compatible identity provider, but that’s not shown here. Sample workflow using Amazon Cognito to federate users for a mobile application A customer starts your app on a mobile device. The app asks the user to sign in. The app uses Login with Amazon resources to accept the user’s credentials. The app uses Cognito APIs to exchange the Login with Amazon ID token for a Cognito token. The app requests temporary security credentials from AWS STS, passing the Cognito token. The temporary security credentials can be used by the app to access any AWS resources required by the app to operate. The role associated with the temporary security credentials and its assigned policies determines what can be accessed. Use the following process to configure your app to use Amazon Cognito to authenticate users and give your app access to AWS resources. For specific steps to accomplish this scenario, consult the documentation for Amazon Cognito. (Optional) Sign up as a developer with Login with Amazon, Facebook, Google, or any other OpenID Connect (OIDC)–compatible identity provider and configure one or more apps with the provider. This step is optional because Amazon Cognito also supports unauthenticated (guest) access for your users. Go to Amazon Cognito in the AWS Management Console. Use the Amazon Cognito wizard to create an identity pool, which is a container that Amazon Cognito uses to keep end user identities organized for your apps. You can share identity pools between apps. When you set up an identity pool, Amazon Cognito creates one or twoIAM roles (one for authenticated identities, and one for unauthenticated “guest” identities) that define permissions for Amazon Cognito users. Download and integrate the AWS SDK for iOS or the AWS SDK for Android with your app, and import the files required to use Amazon Cognito. Create an instance of the Amazon Cognito credentials provider, passing the identity pool ID, your AWS account number, and the Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the roles that you associated with the identity pool. The Amazon Cognito wizard in the AWS Management Console provides sample code to help you get started. When your app accesses an AWS resource, pass the credentials provider instance to the client object, which passes temporary security credentials to the client. The permissions for the credentials are based on the role or roles that you defined earlier.

answers: C.
Explanation: Granting Cross-account Permission to objects It Does Not Own In this example scenario, you own a bucket and you have enabled other AWS accounts to upload objects. That is, your bucket can have objects that other AWS accounts own. Now, suppose as a bucket owner, you need to grant cross-account permission on objects, regardless of who the owner is, to a user in another account. For example, that user could be a billing application that needs to access object metadata. There are two core issues: The bucket owner has no permissions on those objects created by other AWS accounts. So for the bucket owner to grant permissions on objects it does not own, the object owner, the AWS account that created the objects, must first grant permission to the bucket owner. The bucket owner can then delegate thosepermissions. Bucket owner account can delegate permissions to users in its own account but it cannot delegate permissions to other AWS accounts, because cross-account delegation is not supported. In this scenario, the bucket owner can create an AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) role with permission to access objects, and grant another AWS account permission to assume the role temporarily enabling it to access objects in the bucket. Background: Cross-Account Permissions and Using IAM Roles IAM roles enable several scenarios to delegate access to your resources, and cross-account access is one of the key scenarios. In this example, the bucket owner, Account A, uses an IAM role to temporarily delegate object access cross-account to users in another AWS account, Account C. Each IAM role you create has two policies attached to it: A trust policy identifying another AWS account that can assume the role. An access policy defining what permissions—for example, s3:GetObject—are allowed when someone assumes the role. For a list of permissions you can specify in a policy, see Specifying Permissions in a Policy. The AWS account identified in the trust policy then grants its user permission to assume the role. The user can then do the following to access objects: Assume the role and, in response, get temporary security credentials. Using the temporary security credentials, access the objects in the bucket. For more information about IAM roles, go to Roles (Delegation and Federation) in IAM User Guide. The following is a summary of the walkthrough steps: Account A administrator user attaches a bucket policy granting Account B conditional permission to upload objects. Account A administrator creates an IAM role, establishing trust with Account C, so users in that account can access Account A. The access policy attached to the role limits what user in Account C can do when the user accesses Account A. Account B administrator uploads an object to the bucket owned by Account A, granting full-control permission to the bucket owner. Account C administrator creates a user and attaches a user policy that allows the user to assume the role. User in Account C first assumes the role, which returns the user temporary security credentials. Using those temporary credentials, the user then accesses objects in the bucket. For this example, you need three accounts. The following table shows how we refer to these accounts and the administrator users in these accounts. Per IAM guidelines (see About Using an Administrator User to Create Resources and Grant Permissions) we do not use the account root credentials in this walkthrough. Instead, you create an administrator user in each account and use those credentials in creating resources and granting them permissions AWS Account ID Account Referred To As Administrator User in the Account 1111-1111-1111 Account A AccountAadmin 2222-2222-2222 Account B AccountBadmin 3333-3333-3333 Account C AccountCadmin

Question35: Your company currently has a 2-tier web application running in an on-premises data center.

answers: A.
Explanation: Overview of Creating Amazon EBS-Backed AMIs First, launch an instance from an AMI that’s similar to the AMI that you’d like to create. You can connect to your instance and customize it. When the instance is configured correctly, ensure data integrity by stopping the instance before you create an AMI, then create the image. When you create an Amazon EBS-backed AMI, we automatically register it for you.Amazon EC2 powers down the instance before creating the AMI to ensure that everything on the instance is stopped and in a consistent state during the creation process. If you’re confident that your instance is in a consistent state appropriate for AMI creation, you can tell Amazon EC2 not to power down and reboot the instance. Some file systems, such as XFS, can freeze and unfreeze activity, making it safe to create the image without rebooting the instance. During the AMI-creation process, Amazon EC2 creates snapshots of your instance’s root volume and any other EBS volumes attached to your instance. If any volumes attached to the instance are encrypted, the new AMI only launches successfully on instances that support Amazon EBS encryption. For more information, see Amazon EBS Encryption. Depending on the size of the volumes, it can take several minutes for the AMI-creation process to complete (sometimes up to 24 hours).You may find it more efficient to create snapshots of your volumes prior to creating your AMI. This way, only small, incremental snapshots need to be created when the AMI is created, and the process completes more quickly (the total time for snapshot creation remains the same). For more information, see Creating an Amazon EBS Snapshot. After the process completes, you have a new AMI and snapshot created from the root volume of the instance. When you launch an instance using the new AMI, we create a new EBS volume for its root volume using the snapshot. Both the AMI and the snapshot incur charges to your account until you delete them. For more information, see Deregistering Your AMI. If you add instance-store volumes or EBS volumes to your instance in addition to the root device volume, the block device mapping for the new AMI contains information for these volumes, and the block device mappings for instances that you launch from the new AMI automatically contain information for these volumes. The instance-store volumes specified in the block device mapping for the new instance are new and don’t contain any data from the instance store volumes of the instance you used to create the AMI. The data on EBS volumes persists. For more information, see Block Device Mapping.

 D.  Backup RDS database to S3 using Oracle RMAN Backup the EC2 instances using Amis, and supplement  with EBS snapshots for individual volume restore.
answers: A.
Explanation: Point-In-Time Recovery In addition to the daily automated backup, Amazon RDS archives database change logs. This enables you to recover your database to any point in time during the backup retention period, up to the last five minutes of database usage. Amazon RDS stores multiple copies of your data, but for Single-AZ DB instances these copies are stored in a single availability zone. If for any reason a Single-AZ DB instance becomes unusable, you can use point-in-time recovery to launch a new DB instance with the latest restorable data. For more information on working withpoint-in-time recovery, go to Restoring a DB Instance to a Specified Time. Note Multi-AZ deployments store copies of your data in different Availability Zones for greater levels of data durability. For more information on Multi-AZ deployments, see High Availability (Multi-AZ).

answers: D.
Explanation: Amazon RDS Multi-AZ Deployments Amazon RDS Multi-AZ deployments provide enhanced availability and durability for Database (DB) Instances, making them a natural fit for production database workloads. When you provision a Multi-AZ DB Instance, Amazon RDS automatically creates a primary DB Instance and synchronously replicates the data to a standby instance in a different Availability Zone (AZ). Each AZ runs on its own physically distinct, independent infrastructure, and is engineered to be highly reliable. In case of an infrastructure failure (for example, instance hardware failure, storage failure, or network disruption), Amazon RDS performs an automatic failover to the standby, so that you can resume database operations as soon as the failover is complete. Since the endpoint for your DB Instance remains the same after a failover, your application can resume database operation without the need for manual administrative intervention. Enhanced Durability Multi-AZ deployments for the MySQL, Oracle, and PostgreSQL engines utilize synchronous physical replication to keep data on the standby up-to-date with the primary. Multi-AZ deployments for the SQL Server engine use synchronous logical replication to achieve the same result, employing SQL Server-native Mirroring technology. Both approaches safeguard your data in the event of a DB Instance failure or loss of an Availability Zone. If a storage volume on your primary fails in a Multi-AZ deployment, Amazon RDS automatically initiates afailover to the up-to-date standby. Compare this to a Single-AZ deployment: in case of a Single-AZ database failure, a user-initiated point-in-time-restore operation will be required. This operation can take several hours to complete, and any data updates that occurred after the latest restorable time (typically within the last five minutes) will not be available. Amazon Aurora employs a highly durable, SSD-backed virtualized storage layer purpose-built for database workloads. Amazon Aurora automatically replicates your volume six ways, across three Availability Zones. Amazon Aurora storage is fault-tolerant, transparently handling the loss of up to two copies of data without affecting database write availability and up to three copies without affecting read availability. Amazon Aurora storage is also self-healing. Data blocks and disks are continuously scanned for errors and replaced automatically. Increased Availability You also benefit from enhanced database availability when running Multi-AZ deployments. If an Availability Zone failure or DB Instance failure occurs, your availability impact is limited to the time automatic failover takes to complete: typically under one minute for Amazon Aurora and one to two minutes for other database engines (see the RDS FAQ for details). The availability benefits of Multi-AZ deployments also extend to planned maintenance and backups. In the case of system upgrades like OS patching or DB Instance scaling, these operations are applied first on the standby, prior to the automatic failover. As a result, your availability impact is, again, only the time required for automatic failover to complete. Unlike Single-AZ deployments, I/O activity is not suspended on your primary during backup for Multi-AZ deployments for the MySQL, Oracle, and PostgreSQL engines, because the backup is taken from the standby. However, note that you may still experience elevated latencies for a few minutes during backups for Multi-AZ deployments. On instance failure in Amazon Aurora deployments, Amazon RDS uses RDS Multi-AZ technology to automate failover to one of up to 15 Amazon Aurora Replicas you have created in any of three Availability Zones. If no Amazon Aurora Replicas have been provisioned, in the case of a failure, Amazon RDS will attempt to create a new Amazon Aurora DB instance for you automatically.

answers: C.
Explanation: Using Reduced Redundancy Storage Amazon S3 stores objects according to their storage class. It assigns the storage class to an object when it is written to Amazon S3. You can assign objects a specific storage class (standard or reduced redundancy) only when you write the objects to an Amazon S3 bucket or when you copy objects that are already stored inAmazon S3. Standard is the default storage class. For information about storage classes, see Object Key and Metadata. In order to reduce storage costs, you can use reduced redundancy storage for noncritical, reproducible data at lower levels of redundancy than Amazon S3 provides with standard storage. The lower level of redundancy results in less durability and availability, but in many cases, the lower costs can make reduced redundancy storage an acceptable storage solution. For example, it can be a cost-effective solution for sharing media content that is durably stored elsewhere. It can also make sense if you are storing thumbnails and other resized images that can be easily reproduced from an original image. Reduced redundancy storage is designed to provide 99.99% durability of objects over a given year. This durability level corresponds to an average annual expected loss of 0.01% of objects. For example, if you store 10,000 objects using the RRS option, you can, on average, expect to incur an annual loss of a single object per year (0.01% of 10,000 objects). Note: This annual loss represents an expected average and does not guarantee the loss of less than 0.01% of objects in a given year. Reduced redundancy storage stores objects on multiple devices across multiple facilities, providing 400 times the durability of a typical disk drive, but it does not replicate objects as many times as Amazon S3 standard storage. In addition, reduced redundancy storage is designed to sustain the loss of data in a single facility. If an object in reduced redundancy storage has been lost, Amazon S3 will return a 405 error on requests made to that object. Amazon S3 also offers notifications for reduced redundancy storage object loss: you can configure your bucket so that when Amazon S3 detects the loss of an RRS object, a notification will be sent through Amazon Simple Notification Service (Amazon SNS). You can then replace the lost object. To enable notifications, you can use the Amazon S3 console to set the Notifications property of your bucket.

answers: D.
Explanation: Amazon EBS allows you to create storage volumes and attach them to Amazon EC2 instances. Once attached, you can create a file system on top of these volumes, run a database, or use them in any other way you would use a block device. Amazon EBS volumes are placed in a specific Availability Zone, where they are automatically replicated to protect you from the failure of a single component. Amazon EBS provides three volume types: General Purpose (SSD), Provisioned IOPS (SSD), and Magnetic. The three volume types differ in performance characteristics and cost, so you can choose the right storage performance and price for the needs of your applications. All EBS volume types offer the same durable snapshot capabilities and are designed for 99.999% availability.

Explanation: AWS Direct Connect AWS Direct Connect makes it easy to establish a dedicated network connection from your premises to AWS. Using AWS Direct Connect, you can establish private connectivity between AWS and your datacenter, office, or collocation environment, which in many cases can reduce your network costs, increase bandwidth throughput, and provide a more consistent network experience than Internet-based connections. AWS Direct Connect lets you establish a dedicated network connection between your network and one of the AWS Direct Connect locations. Using industry standard 802.1q VLANs, this dedicated connection can be partitioned into multiple virtual interfaces. This allows you to use the same connection to access public resources such as objects stored in Amazon S3 using public IP address space, and private resources such as Amazon EC2 instances running within an Amazon Virtual Private Cloud (VPC) using private IP space, while maintaining network separation between the public and private environments. Virtual interfaces can be reconfigured at any time to meet your changing needs. What is AWS Direct Connect? AWS Direct Connect links your internal network to an AWS Direct Connect location over a standard 1 gigabit or 10 gigabit Ethernet fiber-optic cable. One end of the cable is connected to your router, the other to an AWS Direct Connect router. With this connection in place, you can create virtual interfaces directly to the AWS cloud (for example, to Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (Amazon EC2) and Amazon Simple Storage Service (Amazon S3) and to Amazon Virtual Private Cloud (Amazon VPC), bypassing Internet service providers in your network path. An AWS Direct Connect location provides access to Amazon Web Services in the region it is associated with, as well as access to other US regions. For example, you can provision a single connection to any AWS Direct Connect location in the US and use it to access public AWS services in all US Regions and AWS GovCloud (US). The following diagram shows how AWS Direct Connect interfaces with your network. Requirements To use AWS Direct Connect, your network must meet one of the following conditions: Your network is collocated with an existing AWS Direct Connect location. For more information on available AWS Direct Connect locations, go to http://aws.amazon.com/directconnect/. You are working with an AWS Direct Connect partner who is a member of the AWS Partner Network (APN). For a list of AWS Direct Connect partners who can help you connect, go to http://aws.amazon.com/ directconnect. You are working with an independent service provider to connect to AWS Direct Connect. In addition, your network must meet the following conditions: Connections to AWS Direct Connect require single mode fiber, 1000BASE-LX (1310nm) for 1 gigabit Ethernet, or 10GBASE-LR (1310nm) for 10 gigabit Ethernet. Auto Negotiation for the port must be disabled. You must support 802.1Q VLANs across these connections. Your network must support Border Gateway Protocol (BGP) and BGP MD5 authentication. Optionally, you may configure Bidirectional Forwarding Detection (BFD). To connect to Amazon Virtual Private Cloud (Amazon VPC), you must first do the following: Provide a private Autonomous System Number (ASN). Amazon allocates a private IP address in the 169.x.x.x range to you. Create a virtual private gateway and attach it to your VPC. For more information about creating a virtual private gateway, see Adding a Hardware Virtual Private Gateway to Your VPC in the Amazon VPC User Guide. To connect to public AWS products such as Amazon EC2 and Amazon S3, you need to provide the following: A public ASN that you own (preferred) or a private ASN. Public IP addresses (/31) (that is, one for each end of the BGP session) for each BGP session. If you do not have public IP addresses to assign to this connection, log on to AWS and then open a ticket with AWS Support. The public routes that you will advertise over BGP.

answers: B. 
 E.
Explanation: How Health Checks Work in Complex Amazon Route 53 Configurations Checking the health of resources in complex configurations works much the same way as in simple configurations. However, in complex configurations, you use a combination of alias resource record sets (including weighted alias, latency alias, and failover alias) and nonalias resource record sets to build a decision tree that gives you greater control over how Amazon Route 53 responds to requests. For more information, seeHow Health Checks Work in Simple Amazon Route 53 Configurations. For example, you might use latency alias resource record sets to select a region close to a user and use weighted resource record sets for two or more resources within each region to protect against the failure of a single endpoint or an Availability Zone. The following diagram shows this configuration. Here’s how Amazon EC2 and Amazon Route 53 are configured: You have Amazon EC2 instances in two regions, us-east-1 and ap-southeast-2. You want Amazon Route 53 to respond to queries by using the resource record sets in the region that provides the lowest latency for your customers, so you create a latency alias resource record set for each region. (You create the latency alias resource record sets after you create resource record sets for the individual Amazon EC2 instances.) Within each region, you have two Amazon EC2 instances. You create a weighted resource record set for each instance. The name and the type are the same for both of the weighted resource record sets in each region. When you have multiple resources in a region, you can create weighted or failover resource record sets for your resources. You can also create even more complex configurations by creating weighted alias or failover alias resource record sets that, in turn, refer to multiple resources. Each weighted resource record set has an associated health check. The IP address for each health check matches the IP address for the corresponding resource record set. This isn’t required, but it’s the most common configuration. For both latency alias resource record sets, you set the value of Evaluate Target Health to Yes. You use the Evaluate Target Health setting for each latency alias resource record set to make Amazon Route 53 evaluate the health of the alias targets—the weighted resource record sets—and respond accordingly. The preceding diagram illustrates the following sequence of events: Amazon Route 53 receives a query for example.com. Based on the latency for the user making the request, Amazon Route 53 selects the latency alias resource record set for the us-east-1 region. Amazon Route 53 selects a weighted resource record set based on weight. Evaluate Target Health is Yes for the latency alias resource record set, so Amazon Route 53 checks the health of the selected weighted resource record set. The health check failed, so Amazon Route 53 chooses another weighted resource record set based on weight and checks its health. That resource record set also is unhealthy. Amazon Route 53 backs out of that branch of the tree, looks for the latency alias resource record set with the next-best latency, and chooses the resource record set for ap-southeast-2. Amazon Route 53 again selects a resource record set based on weight, and then checks the health of the selected resource record set. The health check passed, so Amazon Route 53 returns the applicable value in response to the query. What Happens When You Associate a Health Check with an Alias Resource Record Set? You can associate a health check with an alias resource record set instead of or in addition to setting the value of Evaluate Target Health to Yes. However, it’s generally more useful if Amazon Route 53 responds to queries based on the health of the underlying resources—the HTTP servers, database servers, and other resources that your alias resource record sets refer to. For example, suppose the following configuration: You assign a health check to a latency alias resource record set for which the alias target is a group of weighted resource record sets. You set the value of Evaluate Target Health to Yes for the latency alias resource record set. In this configuration, both of the following must be true before Amazon Route 53 will return the applicable value for a weighted resource record set: The health check associated with the latency alias resource record set must pass. At least one weighted resource record set must be considered healthy, either because it’s associated with a health check that passes or because it’s not associated with a health check. In the latter case, Amazon Route 53 always considers the weighted resource record set healthy. If the health check for the latency alias resource record set fails, Amazon Route 53 stops responding to queries using any of the weighted resource record sets in the alias target, even if they’re all healthy. Amazon Route 53 doesn’t know the status of the weighted resource record sets because it never looks past the failed health check on the alias resource record set. What Happens When You Omit Health Checks? In a complex configuration, it’s important to associate health checks with all of the non-alias resource record sets. Let’s return to the preceding example, but assume that a health check is missing on one of the weighted resource record sets in the us-east-1 region: Here’s what happens when you omit a health check on a non-alias resource record set in this configuration:Amazon Route 53 receives a query for example.com. Based on the latency for the user making the request, Amazon Route 53 selects the latency alias resource record set for the us-east-1 region. Amazon Route 53 looks up the alias target for the latency alias resource record set, and checks the status of the corresponding health checks. The health check for one weighted resource record set failed, so that resource record set is omitted from consideration. The other weighted resource record set in the alias target for the us-east-1 region has no health check. The corresponding resource might or might not be healthy, but without a health check, Amazon Route 53 has no way to know. Amazon Route 53 assumes that the resource is healthy and returns the applicable value in response to the query. What Happens When You Set Evaluate Target Health to No? In general, you also want to set Evaluate Target Health to Yes for all of the alias resource record sets. In the following example, all of the weighted resource record sets have associated health checks, but Evaluate Target Health is set to No for the latency alias resource record set for the us-east-1 region: Here’s what happens when you set Evaluate Target Health to No for an alias resource record set in this configuration: Amazon Route 53 receives a query for example.com. Based on the latency for the user making the request, Amazon Route 53 selects the latency alias resource record set for the us-east-1 region. Amazon Route 53 determines what the alias target is for the latency alias resource record set, and checks the corresponding health checks. They’re both failing. Because the value of Evaluate Target Health is No for the latency alias resource record set for the us-east-1 region, Amazon Route 53 must choose one resource record set in this branch instead of backing out of the branch and looking for a healthy resource record set in the ap-southeast-2 region.

Question54: To serve Web traffic for a popular product your chief financial officer and IT director have purchased 10 ml large heavy utilization Reserved Instances (RIs) evenly spread across two availability zones: Route 53 is used to deliver the traffic to an Elastic Load Balancer (ELB).

What backup solution would be most appropriate for this use case?
 A.  Use Storage Gateway and configure it to use Gateway Cached volumes.
 B.  Configure your backup software to use S3 as the target for your data backups.
 C.  Configure your backup software to use Glacier as the target for your data backups.
 D.  Use Storage Gateway and configure it to use Gateway Stored volumes.
answers: A.
Explanation: Gateway-Cached Volume Architecture Gateway-cached volumes let you use Amazon Simple Storage Service (Amazon S3) as your primary data storage while retaining frequently accessed data locally in your storage gateway. Gateway-cached volumes minimize the need to scale your on-premises storage infrastructure, while still providing your applications with low-latency access to their frequently accessed data. You can create storage volumes up to 32 TiB in size and attach to them as iSCSI devices from your on-premises application servers. Your gateway stores data that you write to these volumes in Amazon S3 and retains recently read data in your on-premises storage gateway’s cache and upload buffer storage. Gateway-cached volumes can range from 1 GiB to 32 TiB in size and must be rounded to the nearest GiB. Each gateway configured for gateway-cached volumes can support up to 32 volumes for a total maximum storage volume of 1,024 TiB (1 PiB). In the gateway-cached volume solution, AWS Storage Gateway stores all your on-premises application data in a storage volume in Amazon S3. The following diagram provides an overview of the AWS Storage Gateway-cached volume deployment. After you’ve installed the AWS Storage Gateway software appliance—the virtual machine (VM)—on a host in your data center and activated it, you can use the AWS Management Console to provision storage volumes backed by Amazon S3. You can also provision storage volumes programmatically using the AWS Storage Gateway API or the AWS SDK libraries. You then mount these storage volumes to your on-premises application servers as iSCSI devices. You also allocate disks on-premises for the VM. These on-premises disks serve the following purposes: Disks for use by the gateway as cache storage – As your applications write data to the storage volumes in AWS, the gateway initially stores the data on the on-premises disks referred to as cache storage before uploading the data to Amazon S3. The cache storage acts as the on-premises durable store for data that is waiting to upload to Amazon S3 from the upload buffer. The cache storage also lets the gateway store your application’s recently accessed data on-premises for lowlatency access. If your application requests data, the gateway first checks the cache storage for the data before checking Amazon S3. You can use the following guidelines to determine the amount of disk space to allocate for cache storage. Generally, you should allocate at least 20 percent of your existing file store size as cache storage. Cache storage should also be larger than the upload buffer. This latter guideline helps ensure cache storage is large enough to persistently hold all data in the upload buffer that has not yet been uploaded to Amazon S3. Disks for use by the gateway as the upload buffer – To prepare for upload to Amazon S3, your gateway also stores incoming data in a staging area, referred to as an upload buffer. Your gateway uploads this buffer data over an encrypted Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) connection to AWS, where it is stored encrypted in Amazon S3. You can take incremental backups, called snapshots, of your storage volumes in Amazon S3. These point-intime snapshots are also stored in Amazon S3 as Amazon EBS snapshots. When you take a new snapshot, only the data that has changed since your last snapshot is stored. You can initiate snapshots on a scheduled or one-time basis. When you delete a snapshot, only the data not needed for any other snapshots is removed. You can restore an Amazon EBS snapshot to a gateway storage volume if you need to recover a backup of your data. Alternatively, for snapshots up to 16 TiB in size, you can use the snapshot as a starting point for anew Amazon EBS volume. You can then attach this new Amazon EBS volume to an Amazon EC2 instance. All gateway-cached volume data and snapshot data is stored in Amazon S3 encrypted at rest using server-side encryption (SSE). However, you cannot access this data with the Amazon S3 API or other tools such as the Amazon S3 console.

Question56: You are looking to migrate your Development (Dev) and Test environments to AWS. You have decided to use separate AWS accounts to host each environment. You plan to link each accounts bill to a Master AWS account using Consolidated Billing. To make sure you Keep within budget you would like to implement a way for administrators in the Master account to have access to stop, delete and/or terminate resources in both the Dev and Test accounts. Identify which option will allow you to achieve this goal.
 A.  Create IAM users in the Master account with full Admin permissions. Create cross-account roles in the Dev  and Test accounts that grant the Master account access to the resources in the account by inheriting  permissions from the Master account.
 B.  Create IAM users and a cross-account role in the Master account that grants full Admin permissions to the  Dev and Test accounts.
 C.  Create IAM users in the Master account Create cross-account roles in the Dev and Test accounts that have  full Admin permissions and grant the Master account access. 
 D.  Link the accounts using Consolidated Billing. This will give IAM users in the Master account access to  resources in the Dev and Test accounts
answers: C.
Explanation: Bucket Owner Granting Cross-account Permission to objects It Does Not Own In this example scenario, you own a bucket and you have enabled other AWS accounts to upload objects. That is, your bucket can have objects that other AWS accounts own. Now, suppose as a bucket owner, you need to grant cross-account permission on objects, regardless of who the owner is, to a user in another account. For example, that user could be a billing application that needs to access object metadata. There are two core issues: The bucket owner has no permissions on those objects created by other AWS accounts. So for the bucket owner to grant permissions on objects it does not own, the object owner, the AWS account that created the objects, must first grant permission to the bucket owner. The bucket owner can then delegate those permissions. Bucket owner account can delegate permissions to users in its own account but it cannot delegate permissions to other AWS accounts, because cross-account delegation is not supported. In this scenario, the bucket owner can create an AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) role with permission to access objects, and grant another AWS account permission to assume the role temporarily enabling it to access objects in the bucket. Background: Cross-Account Permissions and Using IAM Roles IAM roles enable several scenarios to delegate access to your resources, and cross-account access is one of the key scenarios. In this example, the bucket owner, Account A, uses an IAM role to temporarily delegate object access cross-account to users in another AWS account, Account C. Each IAM role you create has two policies attached to it: A trust policy identifying another AWS account that can assume the role. An access policy defining what permissions—for example, s3:GetObject—are allowed when someone assumes the role. For a list of permissions you can specify in a policy, see Specifying Permissions in a Policy. The AWS account identified in the trust policy then grants its user permission to assume the role. The user can then do the following to access objects: Assume the role and, in response, get temporary security credentials. Using the temporary security credentials, access the objects in the bucket. For more information about IAM roles, go to Roles (Delegation and Federation) in IAM User Guide. The following is a summary of the walkthrough steps: Account A administrator user attaches a bucket policy granting Account B conditional permission to upload objects. Account A administrator creates an IAM role, establishing trust with Account C, so users in that account can access Account A. The access policy attached to the role limits what user in Account C can do when the user accesses Account A. Account B administrator uploads an object to the bucket owned by Account A, granting full-control permission to the bucket owner. Account C administrator creates a user and attaches a user policy that allows the user to assume the role. User in Account C first assumes the role, which returns the user temporary security credentials. Using those temporary credentials, the user then accesses objects in the bucket. For this example, you need three accounts. The following table shows how we refer to these accounts and the administrator users in these accounts. Per IAM guidelines (see About Using an Administrator User to Create Resources and Grant Permissions) we do not use the account root credentials in this walkthrough. Instead, you create an administrator user in each account and use those credentials in creating resources and granting them permissions AWS Account ID Account Referred To As Administrator User in the Account 1111-1111-1111 Account A AccountAadmin 2222-2222-2222 Account B AccountBadmin 3333-3333-3333 Account C AccountCadmin

 B.  Use web Identity Federation to retrieve AWS temporary security credentials to enable your NOC members  to sign in to the AWS Management Console.
 C.  Use your on-premises SAML 2.0-compliant identity provider (IDP) to grant the NOC members federated  access to the AWS Management Console via the AWS single sign-on (SSO) endpoint.
 D.  Use your on-premises SAML 2.0-compliam identity provider (IDP) to retrieve temporary security credentials  to enable NOC members to sign in to the AWS Management Console.
answers: D.


Question58: A newspaper organization has a on-premises application which allows the public to search its back catalogue and retrieve individual newspaper pages via a website written in Java They have scanned the old newspapers into JPEGs (approx 17TB) and used Optical Character Recognition (OCR) to populate a commercial search product. The hosting platform and software are now end of life and the organization wants to migrate Its archive to AWS and produce a cost efficient architecture and still be designed for availability and durability. Which is the most appropriate?
 A.  Use S3 with reduced redundancy lo store and serve the scanned files, install the commercial search  application on EC2 Instances and configure with auto-scaling and an Elastic Load Balancer.
 B.  Model the environment using CloudFormation use an EC2 instance running Apache webserver and an open  source search application, stripe multiple standard EBS volumes together to store the JPEGs and search  index.
 C.  Use S3 with standard redundancy to store and serve the scanned files, use CloudSearch for query  processing, and use Elastic Beanstalk to host the website across multiple availability zones. 
 D.  Use a single-AZ RDS MySQL instance lo store the search index 33d the JPEG images use an EC2 instance  to serve the website and translate user queries into SQL.
 E.  Use a CloudFront download distribution to serve the JPEGs to the end users and Install the current  commercial search product, along with a Java Container Tor the website on EC2 instances and use  Route53 with DNS round-robin.
answers: C.
Explanation: There is no such thing as “Most appropriate” without knowing all your goals. I find your scenarios very fuzzy, since you can obviously mix-n-match between them. I think you should decide by layers instead: Load Balancer Layer: ELB or just DNS, or roll-your-own. (Using DNS+EIPs is slightly cheaper, but less reliable than ELB.) Storage Layer for 17TB of Images: This is the perfect use case for S3. Off-load all the web requests directly to the relevant JPEGs in S3. Your EC2 boxes just generate links to them. If your app already serves it’s own images (not links to images), you might start with EFS. But more than likely, you can just setup a web server to re-write or re-direct all JPEG links to S3 pretty easily. If you use S3, don’t serve directly from the bucket – Serve via a CNAME in domain you control. That way, you can switch in CloudFront easily. EBS will be way more expensive, and you’ll need 2x the drives if you need 2 boxes. Yuck. Consider a smaller storage format. For example, JPEG200 or WebP or other tools might make for smaller images. There is also the DejaVu format from a while back. Cache Layer: Adding CloudFront in front of S3 will help people on the other side of the world — well, possibly. Typical archives follow a power law. The long tail of requests means that most JPEGs won’t be requested enough to be in the cache. So you are only speeding up the most popular objects. You can always wait, and switch in CF later after you know your costs better. (In some cases, it can actually lower costs.) You can also put CloudFront in front of your app, since your archive search results should be fairly static. This will also allow you to run with a smaller instance type, since CF will handle much of the load if you do it right. Database Layer: A few options: Use whatever your current server does for now, and replace with something else down the road. Don’t underestimate this approach, sometimes it’s better to start now and optimize later. Use RDS to run MySQL/Postgres I’m not as familiar with ElasticSearch / Cloudsearch, but obviously Cloudsearch will be less maintenance +setup. App Layer: When creating the app layer from scratch, consider CloudFormation and/or OpsWorks. It’s extra stuff to learn, but helps down the road. Java+Tomcat is right up the alley of ElasticBeanstalk. (Basically EC2 + Autoscale + ELB). Preventing Abuse: When you put something in a public S3 bucket, people will hot-link it from their web pages. If you want to prevent that, your app on the EC2 box can generate signed links to S3 that expire in a few hours.Now everyone will be forced to go thru the app, and the app can apply rate limiting, etc. Saving money: If you don’t mind having downtime: run everything in one AZ (both DBs and EC2s). You can always add servers and AZs down the road, as long as it’s architected to be stateless. In fact, you should use multiple regions if you want it to be really robust. use Reduced Redundancy in S3 to save a few hundred bucks per month (Someone will have to “go fix it” every time it breaks, including having an off-line copy to repair S3.) Buy Reserved Instances on your EC2 boxes to make them cheaper. (Start with the RI market and buy a partially used one to get started.) It’s just a coupon saying “if you run this type of box in this AZ, you will save on the per-hour costs.” You can get 1/2 to 1/3 off easily. Rewrite the application to use less memory and CPU – that way you can run on fewer/smaller boxes. (May or may not be worth the investment.) If your app will be used very infrequently, you will save a lot of money by using Lambda. I’d be worried that it would be quite slow if you tried to run a Java application on it though.. We’re missing some information like load, latency expectations from search, indexing speed, size of the search index, etc. But with what you’ve given us, I would go with S3 as the storage for the files (S3 rocks. It is really, really awesome). If you’re stuck with the commercial search application, then on EC2 instances with autoscaling and an ELB. If you are allowed an alternative search engine, Elasticsearch is probably your best bet. I’d run it on EC2 instead of the AWS Elasticsearch service, as IMHO it’s not ready yet. Don’t autoscale Elasticsearch automatically though, it’ll cause all sorts of issues. I have zero experience with CloudSearch so ic an’t comment on that. Regardless of which option, I’d use CloudFormation for all of it.

Question59: Your customer is willing to consolidate their log streams (access logs application logs security logs etc.) in one single system. Once consolidated, the customer wants to analyze these logs in real time based on heuristics. From time to time, the customer needs to validate heuristics, which requires going back to data samples extracted from the last 12 hours? What is the best approach to meet your customer’s requirements?
 A.  Send all the log events to Amazon SQS, setup an Auto Scaling group of EC2 servers to consume the logs  and apply the heuristics.
 B.  Send all the log events to Amazon Kinesis, develop a client process to apply heuristics on the logs 
 C.  Configure Amazon CloudTrail to receive custom logs, use EMR to apply heuristics the logs
 D.  Setup an Auto Scaling group of EC2 syslogd servers, store the logs on S3, use EMR to apply heuristics on  the logs
answers: B.
Explanation: The throughput of an Amazon Kinesis stream is designed to scale without limits via increasing the number of shards within a stream. However, there are certain limits you should keep in mind while using Amazon Kinesis Streams: By default, Records of a stream are accessible for up to 24 hours from the time they are added to the stream. You can raise this limit to up to 7 days by enabling extended data retention. The maximum size of a data blob (the data payload before Base64-encoding) within one record is 1 megabyte (MB). Each shard can support up to 1000 PUT records per second. For more information about other API level limits, see Amazon Kinesis Streams Limits.

Question60: Your company is storing millions of sensitive transactions across thousands of 100-GB files that must be encrypted in transit and at rest. Analysts concurrently depend on subsets of files, which can consume up to 5 TB of space, to generate simulations that can be used to steer business decisions. You are required to design an AWS solution that can cost effectively accommodate the long-term storage and in-flight subsets of data.
 A.  Use Amazon Simple Storage Service (S3) with server-side encryption, and run simulations on subsets in  ephemeral drives on Amazon EC2.
 B.  Use Amazon S3 with server-side encryption, and run simulations on subsets in-memory on Amazon EC2.
 C.  Use HDFS on Amazon EMR, and run simulations on subsets in ephemeral drives on Amazon EC2.
 D.  Use HDFS on Amazon Elastic MapReduce (EMR), and run simulations on subsets in-memory on Amazon  Elastic Compute Cloud (EC2). 
 E.  Store the full data set in encrypted Amazon Elastic Block Store (EBS) volumes, and regularly capture  snapshots that can be cloned to EC2 workstations.
answers: D.


Question61: You have launched an EC2 instance with four (4) 500 GB EBS Provisioned IOPS volumes attached. The EC2 instance is EBS-Optimized and supports 500 Mbps throughput between EC2 and EBS. The four EBS volumes are configured as a single RAID 0 device, and each Provisioned IOPS volume is provisioned with 4,000 IOPS (4,000 16KB reads or writes), for a total of 16,000 random IOPS on the instance. The EC2 instance initially delivers the expected 16,000 IOPS random read and write performance. Sometime later, in order to increase the total random I/O performance of the instance, you add an additional two 500 GB EBS Provisioned IOPS volumes to the RAID. Each volume is provisioned to 4,000 IOPs like the original four, for a total of 24,000 IOPS on the EC2 instance. Monitoring shows that the EC2 instance CPU utilization increased from 50% to 70%, but the total random IOPS measured at the instance level does not increase at all. What is the problem and a valid solution?
 A.  The EBS-Optimized throughput limits the total IOPS that can be utilized; use an EBSOptimized instance that  provides larger throughput.
 B.  Small block sizes cause performance degradation, limiting the I/O throughput; configure the instance device  driver and filesystem to use 64KB blocks to increase throughput.
 C.  The standard EBS Instance root volume limits the total IOPS rate; change the instance root volume to also  be a 500GB 4,000 Provisioned IOPS volume. 
 D.  Larger storage volumes support higher Provisioned IOPS rates; increase the provisioned volume storage of  each of the 6 EBS volumes to 1TB.
 E.  RAID 0 only scales linearly to about 4 devices; use RAID 0 with 4 EBS Provisioned IOPS volumes, but  increase each Provisioned IOPS EBS volume to 6,000 IOPS.
answers: C.
