Question182: You have decided to change the instance type for instances running in your application tier that is using Auto Scaling. In which area below would you change the instance type definition?
 A.  Auto Scaling policy
 B. Auto Scaling group
 C. Auto Scaling tags
 D. Auto Scaling launch configuration
answers: A.
Explanation: When selecting an instance to terminate when a scaling condition is met, Auto Scaling attempts to preserve instances with the current launch configuration, and will thus terminate instances that do not have the current launch configuration. When more than one instance meets this criterion, Auto Scaling will terminate the instance running for the longest portion of a billable instance-hour (without running over). Optionally, you can configure a policy to terminate the oldest or newest instance instead. To target a specific instance for immediate termination, you can also use the TerminateInstanceInAutoScalingGroup API.

 B.  The EBS-Optimized throughput limits the total IOPS that can be utilized use an EBS-Optimized instance that  provides larger throughput.
 C.  Small block sizes cause performance degradation, limiting the I’O throughput, configure the instance device  driver and file system to use 64KB blocks to increase throughput.
 D.  RAID 0 only scales linearly to about 4 devices, use RAID 0 with 4 EBS Provisioned IOPS volumes but increase  each Provisioned IOPS EBS volume to 6.000 IOPS.

Question341: A web-startup runs its very successful social news application on Amazon EC2 with an Elastic Load Balancer, an Auto-Scaling group of Java/Tomcat application-servers, and DynamoDB as data store. The main webapplication best runs on m2 x large instances since it is highly memory- bound Each new deployment requires semi-automated creation and testing of a new AMI for the application servers which takes quite a while ana is therefore only done once per week. Recently, a new chat feature has been implemented in nodejs and wails to be integrated in the architecture.
