Explanation: Ideal Usage Patterns •Amazon DynamoDB is ideal for existing or new applications that need a flexible NoSQL database with low read and write latencies, and the ability to scale storage and throughput up or down as needed without code changes or downtime. •Use cases require a highly available and scalable database because downtime or performance degradation has an immediate negative impact on an organization’s business. for e.g. mobile apps, gaming, digital ad serving, live voting and audience interaction for live events, sensor networks, log ingestion, access control for web-based content, metadata storage for Amazon S3 objects, e-commerce shopping carts, and web session management

Question123: A US-based company is expanding their web presence into Europe. The company wants to extend their AWS infrastructure from Northern Virginia (us-east-1) into the Dublin (eu-west-1) region. Which of the following options would enable an equivalent experience for users on both continents?
 A.  Use a public-facing load balancer per region to load-balance web traffic, and enable HTTP health checks.
 B.  Use a public-facing load balancer per region to load-balance web traffic, and enable sticky sessions.
 C.  Use Amazon Route 53, and apply a geolocation routing policy to distribute traffic across both regions. 
 D.  Use Amazon Route 53, and apply a weighted routing policy to distribute traffic across both regions.
answers: C.
Explanation: Geolocation routing lets you choose the resources that serve your traffic based on the geographic location of your users, meaning the location from which DNS queries originate. For example, you might want all queries from Africa to be routed to a web server with an IP address of 192.0.2.111. Another possible use is for balancing load across endpoints in a predictable, easy-to-manage way, so that each user location is consistently routed to the same endpoint. http://docs.aws.amazon.com/Route53/latest/DeveloperGuide/routing-policy.html#routing-policy-weighted

Question124: An existing application stores sensitive information on a non-boot Amazon EBS data volume attached to an Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud instance. Which of the following approaches would protect the sensitive data on an Amazon EBS volume?
 A.  Upload your customer keys to AWS CloudHSM. Associate the Amazon EBS volume with AWS CloudHSM.  Re-mount the Amazon EBS volume.
 B.  Create and mount a new, encrypted Amazon EBS volume. Move the data to the new volume. Delete the oldAmazon EBS volume. 
 C.  Unmount the EBS volume. Toggle the encryption attribute to True. Re-mount the Amazon EBS volume.
 D.  Snapshot the current Amazon EBS volume. Restore the snapshot to a new, encrypted Amazon EBS  volume. Mount the Amazon EBS volume
answers: B.
Explanation: http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/EBSEncryption.html To migrate data between encrypted and unencrypted volumes: 1. Create your destination volume (encrypted or unencrypted, depending on your need) by following the procedures in Creating an Amazon EBS Volume. 2. Attach the destination volume to the instance that hosts the data to migrate. For more information, see Attaching an Amazon EBS Volume to an Instance. procedures in Making an Amazon EBS Volume Available for Using. For Linux instances, you can create a mount point at /mnt/destination and mount the destination volume there. 4. Copy the data from your source directory to the destination volume. It may be most convenient to use a bulkcopy utility for this.

Question125: Which of the following approaches provides the lowest cost for Amazon Elastic Block Store snapshots while giving you the ability to fully restore data?

 B.  Maintain a volume snapshot; subsequent snapshots will overwrite one another
 C.  Maintain a single snapshot the latest snapshot is both Incremental and complete. 
 D.  Maintain the most current snapshot, archive the original and incremental to Amazon Glacier.
answers: C.
Explanation: http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/ebs-deleting-snapshot.html

Question126: You manually launch a NAT AMI in a public subnet. The network is properly configured. Security groups and network access control lists are property configured. Instances in a private subnet can access the NAT. The NAT can access the Internet. However, private instances cannot access the Internet. What additional step is required to allow access from the private instances?
 A.  Enable Source/Destination Check on the private Instances.
 B.  Enable Source/Destination Check on the NAT instance.
 C.  Disable Source/Destination Check on the private instances.
 D.  Disable Source/Destination Check on the NAT instance.
answers: D.
Explanation: Disabling Source/Destination Checks. Each EC2 instance performs source/destination checks by default. This means that the instance must be the source or destination of any traffic it sends or receives. However, a NAT instance must be able to send and receive traffic when the source or destination is not itself. Therefore, you must disable source/destination checks on the NAT instance. You can disable the SrcDestCheck attribute for a NAT instance that’s either running or stopped using the console or the command line. http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonVPC/latest/UserGuide/VPC_NAT_Instance.html

Question127: A t2.medium EC2 instance type must be launched with what type of Amazon Machine Image (AMI)?
 A.  An Instance store Hardware Virtual Machine AMI
 B.  An Instance store Paravirtual AMI
 C.  An Amazon EBS-backed Hardware Virtual Machine AMI 
 D.  An Amazon EBS-backed Paravirtual AMI
answers: C.
Explanation: You must launch a T2 instance using an HVM AMI. For more information, see Linux AMI Virtualization Types. You must launch your T2 instances using an EBS volume as the root device. For more information, see Amazon EC2 Root Device Volume. http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/ec2-instance-resize.html

Question128: A company is deploying a new two-tier web application in AWS. The company has limited staff and requires high availability, and the application requires complex queries and table joins. Which configuration provides the solution for the company’s requirements?
 A.  MySQL Installed on two Amazon EC2 Instances in a single Availability Zone
 B.  Amazon RDS for MySQL with Multi-AZ 
 C.  Amazon ElastiCache
 D.  Amazon DynamoDB
answers: B.
Explanation: When is it appropriate to use DynamoDB instead of a relational database? From our own experience designing and operating a highly available, highly scalable ecommerce platform, we have come to realize that relational databases should only be used when an application really needs the complex query, table join and transaction capabilities of a full-blown relational database. In all other cases, when such relational features are not needed, a NoSQL database service like DynamoDB offers a simpler, more available, more scalable and ultimately a lower cost solution.

Question129: Which of the following are true regarding encrypted Amazon Elastic Block Store (EBS) volumes? (Choose two.)
 A.  Supported on all Amazon EBS volume types
 B.  Snapshots are automatically encrypted 
 C.  Available to all instance types
 D.  Existing volumes can be encrypted
 E.  shared volumes can be encrypted
answers: A. B.
Explanation: This feature is supported on all Amazon EBS volume types (General Purpose (SSD), Provisioned IOPS (SSD), and Magnetic). You can access encrypted Amazon EBS volumes the same way you access existing volumes; encryption and decryption are handled transparently and they require no additional action from you, your Amazon EC2 instance, or your application. Snapshots of encrypted Amazon EBS volumes are automatically encrypted, and volumes that are created from encrypted Amazon EBS snapshots are also automatically encrypted.

 B.  Assign an IAM role to the Amazon EC2 instance. 
 C.  Store the AWS Access Key ID/Secret Access Key combination in software comments.
 D.  Assign an IAM user to the Amazon EC2 Instance.
answers: B.
Explanation: Use roles for applications that run on Amazon EC2 instances. Applications that run on an Amazon EC2 instance need credentials in order to access other AWS services. To provide credentials to the application in a secure way, use IAM roles. A role is an entity that has its own set of permissions, but that isn’t a user or group. Roles also don’t have their own permanent set of credentials the way IAM users do. In the case of Amazon EC2, IAM dynamically provides temporary credentials to the EC2 instance, and these credentials are automatically rotated for you. http://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/best-practices.html#use-roles-with-ec2

Question140: When will you incur costs with an Elastic IP address (EIP)?
 A.  When an EIP is allocated.
 B.  When it is allocated and associated with a running instance.
 C.  When it is allocated and associated with a stopped instance. 
 D.  Costs are incurred regardless of whether the EIP is associated with a running instance.
answers: C.
Explanation: You can have one Elastic IP (EIP) address associated with a running instance at no charge. If you associate additional EIPs with that instance, you will be charged for each additional EIP associated with that instance per hour on a pro rata basis.

Question141: You are designing a web application that stores static assets in an Amazon Simple Storage Service (S3) bucket. You expect this bucket to immediately receive over 150 PUT requests per second. What should you do to ensure optimal performance?
 A.  Use multi-part upload.
 B.  Add a random prefix to the key names. 
 C.  Amazon S3 will automatically manage performance at this scale.
 D.  Use a predictable naming scheme, such as sequential numbers or date time sequences, in the key names
answers: B.
Explanation: If you anticipate that your workload will consistently exceed 100 requests per second, you should avoid sequential key names. If you must use sequential numbers or date and time patterns in key names, add a random prefix to the key name. The randomness of the prefix more evenly distributes key names across multiple index partitions. Examples of introducing randomness are provided later in this topic.

Question142: A company is deploying a two-tier, highly available web application to AWS. Which service provides durable storage for static content while utilizing lower Overall CPU resources for the web tier?
 A.  Amazon EBS volume

Question144: You have an application running on an Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud instance, that uploads 5 GB video objects to Amazon Simple Storage Service (S3). Video uploads are taking longer than expected, resulting in poor application performance. Which method will help improve performance of your application?
 A.  Enable enhanced networking
 B.  Use Amazon S3 multipart upload 
 C.  Leveraging Amazon CloudFront, use the HTTP POST method to reduce latency.
 D.  Use Amazon Elastic Block Store Provisioned IOPs and use an Amazon EBS-optimized instance
answers: B.
Explanation: Using multipart upload provides the following advantages: – Improved throughput – You can upload parts in parallel to improve throughput. – Quick recovery from any network issues – Smaller part size minimizes the impact of restarting a failed upload due to a network error. – Pause and resume object uploads – You can upload object parts over time. Once you initiate a multipart upload there is no expiry; you must explicitly complete or abort the multipart upload. – Begin an upload before you know the final object size. – You can upload an object as you are creating it. http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/uploadobjusingmpu.html

Question145: A photo-sharing service stores pictures in Amazon Simple Storage Service (S3) and allows application sign-in using an OpenID Connect-compatible identity provider. Which AWS Security Token Service approach to temporary access should you use for the Amazon S3 operations?

Question154: You have a load balancer configured for VPC, and all back-end Amazon EC2 instances are in service. However, your web browser times out when connecting to the load balancer’s DNS name. Which options are probable causes of this behavior? (Choose two.)
 A.  The load balancer was not configured to use a public subnet with an Internet gateway configured
 B.  The Amazon EC2 instances do not have a dynamically allocated private IP address
 C.  The security groups or network ACLs are not property configured for web traffic. 
 D.  The load balancer is not configured in a private subnet with a NAT instance.E. The VPC does not have a VGW configured.
answers: A. C.
Explanation: There is no such thing as VGW. Hence E is not correct answer.

Question155: You have a content management system running on an Amazon EC2 instance that is approaching 100% CPU utilization. Which option will reduce load on the Amazon EC2 instance?
 A.  Create a load balancer, and register the Amazon EC2 instance with it
 B.  Create a CloudFront distribution, and configure the Amazon EC2 instance as the origin
 C.  Create an Auto Scaling group from the instance using the CreateAutoScalingGroup action

 D.  CloudTrail is enabled on a per-service basis.
 E.  Logs can be delivered to a single Amazon S3 bucket for aggregation. 
 F.  CloudTrail is enabled for all available services within a region.
 G.  Logs can only be processed and delivered to the region in which they are generated.
answers: A. C. 
 E.
Explanation: A: have a trail with the Apply trail to all regions option enabled. C: have multiple single region trails. E: Log files from all the regions can be delivered to a single S3 bucket. Global service events are always delivered to trails that have the Apply trail to all regions option enabled. Events are delivered from a single region to the bucket for the trail. This setting cannot be changed. If you have a single region trail, you should enable the Include global services option. If you have multiple single region trails, you should enable the Include global services option in only one of the trails. D: Incorrect. Once enabled it is applicable for all the supported services, service can’t be selected.

Question157: You have a distributed application that periodically processes large volumes of data across multiple Amazon EC2 Instances. The application is designed to recover gracefully from Amazon EC2 instance failures. You are required to accomplish this task in the most cost-effective way. Which of the following will meet your requirements?
 A.  Spot Instances
 B.  Reserved instances
 C.  Dedicated instances
 D.  On-Demand instances
answers: A.
Explanation: Using reserved instances is not the most cost-effective way. https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/aws/new-scheduled-reserved-instances/ “Scheduled Reserved Instance model allows you to reserve instances for predefined blocks of time on a recurring basis for a one-year term, with prices that are generally 5 to 10% lower than the equivalent On-Demand rates.” You can get spot instances with much lower prices:https://aws.amazon.com/ec2/spot/pricing/ “Spot instances are also available to run for a predefined duration in hourly increments up to six hours in length at a significant discount (30-45%) compared to On-Demand pricing plus an additional 5% during off-peak times for a total of up to 50% savings.”

Question158: You have an environment that consists of a public subnet using Amazon VPC and 3 instances that are running in this subnet. These three instances can successfully communicate with other hosts on the Internet. You launch a fourth instance in the same subnet, using the same AMI and security group configuration you used for the others, but find that this instance cannot be accessed from the internet. What should you do to enable Internet access?
 A.  Deploy a NAT instance into the public subnet.
 B.  Assign an Elastic IP address to the fourth instance. 
 C.  Configure a publically routable IP Address in the host OS of the fourth instance.
 D.  Modify the routing table for the public subnet.
answers: B.
Explanation: You launched your instance into a public subnet – a subnet that has a route to an Internet gateway. However, the instance in your subnet also needs a public IP address to be able to communicate with the Internet. By default, an instance in a nondefault VPC is not assigned a public IP address. In this step, you’ll allocate an Elastic IP address to your account, and then associate it with your instance.

Question159: In order to optimize performance for a compute cluster that requires low inter-node latency, which of the following feature should you use?
 A.  Multiple Availability Zones
 B.  AWS Direct Connect
 C.  EC2 Dedicated Instances
 D.  Placement Groups 
 E.  VPC private subnets
answers: D.
Explanation: A placement group is a logical grouping of instances within a single Availability Zone. Using placement groups enables applications to participate in a low-latency, 10 Gigabits per second (Gbps) network. http:// docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/placement-groups.html

Question160: When an EC2 instance that is backed by an S3-based AMI is terminated, what happens to the data on the root volume?
 A.  Data is automatically saved as an EBS snapshot.
 B.  Data is automatically saved as an EBS volume.
 C.  Data is unavailable until the instance is restarted.
 D.  Data is automatically deleted.
answers: D.
Explanation: Using the legacy S3 based AMIs, either of the above terminates the instance and you lose all local and ephemeral storage (boot disk and /mnt) forever. Hope you remembered to save the important stuff elsewhere.

Question161: An Auto-Scaling group spans 3 AZs and currently has 4 running EC2 instances. When Auto Scaling needs to terminate an EC2 instance by default, AutoScaling will: (Choose two.)
 A.  Allow at least five minutes for Windows/Linux shutdown scripts to complete, before terminating the instance.
 B.  Terminate the instance with the least active network connections. If multiple instances meet this criterion,  one will be randomly selected.
 C.  Send an SNS notification, if configured to do so. 
 D.  Terminate an instance in the AZ which currently has 2 running EC2 instances. 
 E.  Randomly select one of the 3 AZs, and then terminate an instance in that AZ.
answers: C. 
 D.
Explanation: Auto Scaling determines whether there are instances in multiple Availability Zones. If so, it selects the Availability Zone with the most instances and at least one instance that is not protected from scale in. http:// docs.aws.amazon.com/AutoScaling/latest/DeveloperGuide/AutoScalingBehavior.InstanceTermination.html

Question162: You are working with a customer who is using Chef configuration management in their data center. Which service is designed to let the customer leverage existing Chef recipes in AWS?

Question163: You run an ad-supported photo sharing website using S3 to serve photos to visitors of your site. At some point you find out that other sites have been linking to the photos on your site, causing loss to your business. What is an effective method to mitigate this?
 A.  Remove public read access and use signed URLs with expiry dates.
 B.  Use CloudFront distributions for static content.
 C.  Block the IPs of the offending websites in Security Groups.
 D.  Store photos on an EBS volume of the web server.
answers: A.
Explanation: A signed URL includes additional information, for example, an expiration date and time, that gives you more control over access to your content.

Question164: A customer needs corporate IT governance and cost oversight of all AWS resources consumed by its divisions. The divisions want to maintain administrative control of the discrete AWS resources they consume and keep those resources separate from the resources of other divisions. Which of the following options, when used together will support the autonomy/control of divisions while enabling corporate IT to maintain governance and cost oversight? (Choose two.)
 A.  Use AWS Consolidated Billing and disable AWS root account access for the child accounts.
 B.  Enable IAM cross-account access for all corporate IT administrators in each child account. 
 C.  Create separate VPCs for each division within the corporate IT AWS account.
 D.  Use AWS Consolidated Billing to link the divisions’ accounts to a parent corporate account. 
 E.  Write all child AWS CloudTrail and Amazon CloudWatch logs to each child account’s Amazon S3 ‘Log’  bucket.
answers: B. 
 D.
Explanation: B & D are correct when used in combination with each other. C is theoretically correct by itself, but does not work well with the other choices since it involves only a single AWS account, and the other possibly correct choices (B & D) both involve separate AWS accounts. The question specifically states “Which of the following options, when used together”. So C is out. A is incorrect because you don’t want to disable root access to the child accounts (well, except for their access keys for API calls, deleting those is OK). E is incorrect because it’s the exact opposite of a best practice to centralize logs/security audit info across multiple corporate AWS accounts:

Question165: You are tasked with setting up a Linux bastion host for access to Amazon EC2 instances running in your VPC. Only clients connecting from the corporate external public IP address 72.34.51.100 should have SSH access to the host. Which option will meet the customer requirement?
 A.  Security Group Inbound Rule: Protocol – TCP. Port Range – 22, Source 72.34.51.100/32
 B.  Security Group Inbound Rule: Protocol – UDP, Port Range – 22, Source 72.34.51.100/32
 C.  Network ACL Inbound Rule: Protocol – UDP, Port Range – 22, Source 72.34.51.100/32

Question166: Which of the following requires a custom CloudWatch metric to monitor?
 A.  Memory Utilization of an EC2 instance
 B.  CPU Utilization of an EC2 instance
 C.  Disk usage activity of an EC2 instance
 D.  Data transfer of an EC2 instance
answers: A.
Explanation: CloudWatch relies on the information provided by this hypervisor, which can only see the most hardware-sided part of the instance’s status, including CPU usage (but not load), total memory size (but not memory usage), number of I/O operations on the hard disks (but not it’s partition layout and space usage) and network traffic (but not the processes generating it).

Question167: Which Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud feature can you query from within the instance to access instance properties?
 A.  Instance user data
 B.  Resource tags
 C.  Instance metadata 
 D.  Amazon Machine Image
answers: C.
Explanation: Although you can only access instance metadata and user data from within the instance itself, the data is not protected by cryptographic methods. http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/ec2-instance-metadata.html#instancedata-dataretrieval

Question168: Which of the following are characteristics of a reserved instance? (Choose three.)
 A.  It can be migrated across Availability Zones
 B.  It is specific to an Amazon Machine Image (AMI)
 C.  It can be applied to instances launched by Auto Scaling 
 D.  It is specific to an instance Type
 E.  It can be used to lower Total Cost of Ownership (TCO) of a system
answers: A. C. 
 E.
Explanation: You can use Auto Scaling or other AWS services to launch the On-Demand instances that use your Reserved Instance benefits. For information about launching On-Demand instances, see Launch Your Instance. For information about launching instances using Auto Scaling, see the Auto Scaling User Guide. http:// docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/concepts-on-demand-reserved-instances.html https:// forums.aws.amazon.com/thread.jspa?threadID=56501

Question169: Which features can be used to restrict access to data in S3? (Choose two.)
 A.  Set an S3 ACL on the bucket or the object.
 B.  Create a CloudFront distribution for the bucket.
 C.  Set an S3 bucket policy. 
 D.  Enable IAM Identity Federation
 E.  Use S3 Virtual Hosting
answers: A. C.
Explanation: Amazon S3 is secure by default. Only the bucket and object owners originally have access to Amazon S3 resources they create. Amazon S3 supports user authentication to control access to data. You can use access control mechanisms such as bucket policies and Access Control Lists (ACLs) to selectively grant permissions to users and groups of users. You can securely upload/download your data to Amazon S3 via SSL endpoints using the HTTPS protocol. If you need extra security you can use the Server Side Encryption (SSE) option or the Server Side Encryption with Customer-Provide Keys (SSE-C) option to encrypt data stored-at-rest. Amazon S3 provides the encryption technology for both SSE and SSE-C. Alternatively you can use your own encryption libraries to encrypt data before storing it in Amazon S3. https://aws.amazon.com/s3/faqs/

Question170: You are configuring your company’s application to use Auto Scaling and need to move user state information. Which of the following AWS services provides a shared data store with durability and low latency?
 A.  AWS ElastiCache Memcached
 B.  Amazon Simple Storage Service
 C.  Amazon EC2 instance storage
 D.  Amazon DynamoDB
answers: D.
Explanation: https://media.amazonwebservices.com/AWS_Storage_Options.pdf To speed access to relevant data, many developers pair Amazon S3 with a database, such as Amazon DynamoDB or Amazon RDS. Amazon S3 stores the actual information, and the database serves as therepository for associated metadata (e.g., object name, size, keywords, and so on). Metadata in the database can easily be indexed and queried, making it very efficient to locate an object’s reference via a database query. This result can then be used to pinpoint and then retrieve the object itself from Amazon S3.

Question171: Which of the following are valid statements about Amazon S3? (Choose two.)
 A.  S3 provides read-after-write consistency for any type of PUT or DELETE
 B.  Consistency is not guaranteed for any type of PUT or DELETE
 C.  A successful response to a PUT request only occurs when a complete object is saved. 
 D.  Partially saved objects are immediately readable with a GET after an overwrite PUT.
 E.  S3 provides eventual consistency for overwrite PUTS and DELETES.
answers: C. 
 E.

 C.  1. Suspend disk I/O, 2. Create an image of the EC2 Instance, 3. Resume disk I/O
 D.  1. Suspend disk I/O, 2. Start EBS snapshot of volumes, 3. Resume disk I/O
 E.  1. Suspend disk I/O, 2. Start EBS snapshot of volumes, 3. Wait for snapshots to complete, 4. Resume disk  I/O
answers: B.
Explanation: https://aws.amazon.com/cn/premiumsupport/knowledge-center/snapshot-ebs-raid-array/ To create an “application-consistent” snapshot of your RAID array, stop applications from writing to the RAID array, and flush all caches to disk. Then ensure that the associated EC2 instance is no longer writing to the RAID array by taking steps such as freezing the file system, unmounting the RAID array, or *shutting down the associated EC2 instance*. After completing the steps to halt all I/O, take a snapshot of each EBS volume. http:// docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/ebs-detaching-volume.html You can detach an Amazon EBS volume from an instance explicitly or by terminating the instance. However, if the instance is running, you must first unmount the volume from the instance.”

Question195: When you put objects in Amazon S3, what is the indication that an object was successfully stored?
 A.  A HTTP 200 result code and MD5 checksum, taken together, indicate that the operation was successful.
 B.  Amazon S3 is engineered for 99.999999999% durability. Therefore there is no need to confirm that data  was inserted.
 C.  A success code is inserted into the S3 object metadata.
 D.  Each S3 account has a special bucket named _s3_logs. Success codes are written to this bucket with a  timestamp and checksum.
answers: A.
Explanation: To ensure that data is not corrupted traversing the network, use the Content-MD5 form field. When you use this form field, Amazon S3 checks the object against the provided MD5 value. If they do not match, Amazon S3 returns an error. The status code returned to the client upon successful upload if success_action_redirect is not specified. Accepts the values 200, 201, or 204 (default). http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/API/RESTObjectPOST.html

Question197: When an EC2 EBS-backed (EBS root) instance is stopped, what happens to the data on any ephemeral store volumes?
 A.  Data is automatically saved in an EBS volume.
 B.  Data is unavailable until the instance is restarted. 
 C.  Data will be deleted and will no longer be accessible.
 D.  Data is automatically saved as an EBS snapshot.
answers: B.
Explanation: http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/ComponentsAMIs.html An “EBS-backed” instance is an EC2 instance which uses an EBS volume as it’s root device. An EBS volume behaves like a raw, unformatted, external block device that you can attach to a single instance and are not physically attached to the Instance host computer (more like a network attached storage). The volume persists independently from the running life of an instance. After an EBS volume is attached to an instance, you can use it like any other physical hard drive. You can also detach an EBS volume from one instance and attach it to another instance. EBS volumes can also be created as encrypted volumes using the Amazon EBS encryption feature.

Question214: Which of the following features ensures even distribution of traffic to Amazon EC2 instances in multiple Availability Zones registered with a load balancer?
 A.  Elastic Load Balancing request routing
 B.  An Amazon Route 53 weighted routing policy
 C.  Elastic Load Balancing cross-zone load balancing 
 D.  An Amazon Route 53 latency routing policy
answers: C.
Explanation: Cross-zone load balancing is always enabled for an Application Load Balancer and is disabled by default for a Classic Load Balancer. If cross-zone load balancing is enabled, the load balancer distributes traffic evenly across all registered instances in all enabled Availability Zones. If cross-zone load balancing is disabled, the load balancer distributes traffic evenly across all enabled Availability Zones. For example, suppose that you have 10 instances in Availability Zone us-west-2a and 2 instances in us-west-2b. If cross-zone load balancing is disabled, the requests are distributed evenly between us-west-2a and us-west-2b. As a result, the 2 instances in us-west-2b serve the same amount of traffic as the 10 instances in us-west-2a. However, if cross-zone load balancing is enabled, the load balancer distributes incoming requests evenly across all 12 instances. http://docs.aws.amazon.com/elasticloadbalancing/latest/userguide/how-elastic-load-balancing-works.html

Question215: If you’re unable to connect via SSH to your EC2 instance, which of the following should you check and possibly correct to restore connectivity?

Question238: Can I initiate a “forced failover” for my Oracle Multi-AZ DB Instance deployment?
 A.  Yes
 B.  Only in certain regions
 C.  Only in VPC
 D.  No
answers: A.
Explanation: https://aws.amazon.com/public-data-sets/If your DB instance is a Multi-AZ deployment, you can force a failover from one availability zone to another when you select the Reboot option. When you force a failover of your DB instance, Amazon RDS automatically switches to a standby replica in another Availability Zone and updates the DNS record for the DB instance to point to the standby DB instance. As a result, you will need to clean up and re-establish any existing connections to your DB instance. Reboot with failover is beneficial when you want to simulate a failure of a DB instance for testing, or restore operations to the original AZ after a failover occurs. Source: http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/UserGuide/USER_RebootInstance.html

Question247: Within the IAM service a GROUP is regarded as a:
 A.  A collection of AWS accounts
 B.  It’s the group of EC2 machines that gain the permissions specified in the GROUP.
 C.  There’s no GROUP in IAM, but only USERS and RESOURCES.
 D.  A collection of users.
answers: D.
Explanation: Use groups to assign permissions to IAM users Instead of defining permissions for individual IAM users, it’s usually more convenient to create groups that relate to job functions (administrators, developers, accounting, etc.), define the relevant permissions for each group, and then assign IAM users to those groups. All the users in an IAM group inherit the permissions assigned to the group. That way, you can make changes for everyone in a group in just one place. As people move around in your company, you can simply change what IAM group their IAM user belongs to. http://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/best-practices.html#use-groups-for-permissions

 C.  It encrypts the files that you send to Amazon S3, on the server side. 
 D.  It allows to upload files using an SSL endpoint, for a secure transfer.
answers: C.
Explanation: Server-side encryption is about protecting data at rest. Server-side encryption with Amazon S3-managed encryption keys (SSE-S3) employs strong multi-factor encryption. Amazon S3 encrypts each object with a unique key. As an additional safeguard, it encrypts the key itself with a master key that it regularly rotates. Amazon S3 server-side encryption uses one of the strongest block ciphers available, 256-bit Advanced Encryption Standard (AES-256), to encrypt your data.  https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/UsingServerSideEncryption.html

Question285: Which DNS name can only be resolved within Amazon EC2?
 A.  Internal DNS name
 B.  External DNS name
 C.  Global DNS name
 D.  Private DNS name
answers: A.
Explanation: Using Private Hosted Zones If you want to access the resources in your VPC using custom DNS domain names, such as example.com, instead of using private IP addresses or AWS-provided private DNS hostnames, you can create a private hosted zone in Amazon Route 53. A private hosted zone is a container that holds information about how you want to route traffic for a domain and its subdomains within one or more VPCs without exposing your resources to the Internet. You can then create Amazon Route 53 resource record sets, which determine how Amazon Route 53 responds to queries for your domain and subdomains. For example, if you want browser requests for example.com to be routed to a web server in your VPC, you’ll create an A record in your private hosted zone and specify the IP address of that web server. For more information about creating a private hosted zone, see Working with Private Hosted Zones in the Amazon Route 53 Developer Guide.

Question297: Can I initiate a “forced failover” for my MySQL Multi-AZ DB Instance deployment?
 A.  Only in certain regions
 B.  Only in VPC
 C.  Yes
 D.  No
answers: A.
Explanation: If your DB instance is a Multi-AZ deployment, you can force a failover from one availability zone to another when you select the Reboot option. When you force a failover of your DB instance, Amazon RDS automatically switches to a standby replica in another Availability Zone and updates the DNS record for the DB instance to point to the standby DB instance. As a result, you will need to clean up and re-establish any existing connections to your DB instance. Reboot with failover is beneficial when you want to simulate a failure of a DB instance for testing, or restore operations to the original AZ after a failover occurs.

Question367: IAM provides several policy templates you can use to automatically assign permissions to the groups you create. The _____ policy template gives the Admins group permission to access all account resources, except your AWS account information
 A.  Read Only Access
 B.  Power User Access
 C.  AWS Cloud Formation Read Only Access
 D.  Administrator Access
answers: D.
Explanation: AWS managed policies are designed to provide permissions for many common use cases. For example, there are AWS managed policies that define typical permissions for administrators (all access), for power users (all access except IAM), and for other various levels of access to AWS services. AWS managed policies make it easier for you to assign appropriate permissions to users, groups, and roles than if you had to write the policies yourself. http://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/access_policies_managed-vs-inline.html

Question368: Provisioned IOPS Costs: you are charged for the IOPS and storage whether or not you use them in a given month.
 A.  FALSE
 B.  TRUE
answers: B.
Explanation: Volume storage for EBS Provisioned IOPS SSD (io1) volumes is charged by the amount you provision in GB per month, until you release the storage. With Provisioned IOPS SSD (io1) volumes, you are also charged by the amount you provision in IOPS (input/output operations per second) multiplied by the percentage of days you provision for the month. For example, if you provision a volume with 1000 IOPS, and keep this volume for 15 days in a 30 day month, then in a Region that charges $0.10 per provisioned IOPS-month, you would be charged $50 for the IOPS that you provision ($0.10 per provisioned IOPS-month * 1000 IOPS provisioned * 15 days/30). You will be charged for the IOPS provisioned on a volume even when the volume is detached from an instance.

Question392: Out of the stripping options available for the EBS volumes, which one has the following disadvantage : ‘Doubles the amount of I/O required from the instance to EBS compared to RAID 0, because you’re mirroring all writes to a pair of volumes, limiting how much you can stripe.’ ?
 A.  Raid 0
 B.  RAID 1+0 (RAID 10) 
 C.  Raid 1
 D.  Raid
answers: B.
Explanation: http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/WindowsGuide/raid-config.html raid 0 and 1 are the common types. Raid 5 and 6 are not recommended because of the extended stripe. If you encounter this question on the exam I suspect the answer options will be different. Raid 1 Disadvantage Does not provide a write performance improvement; requires more Amazon EC2 to Amazon EBS bandwidth than non- RAID configurations because the data is written to multiple volumes simultaneously. Raid 0 Disadvantage Performance of the stripe is limited to the worst performing volume in the set. Loss of a single volume results in a complete data loss for the array. Raid 5 and 6 notes RAID 5 and RAID 6 are not recommended for Amazon EBS because the parity write operations of these RAID modes consume some of the IOPS available to your volumes. Depending on the configuration of your RAID array, these RAID modes provide 20-30% fewer usable IOPS than a RAID 0 configuration. Increased cost is afactor with these RAID modes as well; when using identical volume sizes and speeds, a 2-volume RAID 0 array can outperform a 4-volume RAID 6 array that costs twice as much.

Question442: You are running a successful multitier web application on AWS and your marketing department has asked you to add a reporting tier to the application. The reporting tier will aggregate and publish status reports every 30 minutes from user-generated information that is being stored in your web application s database. You are currently running a Multi-AZ RDS MySQL instance for the database tier. You also have implemented Elasticache as a database caching layer between the application tier and database tier. Please select the answer that will allow you to successfully implement the reporting tier with as little impact as possible to your database.
 A.  Continually send transaction logs from your master database to an S3 bucket and generate the reports off  the S3 bucket using S3 byte range requests.
 B.  Generate the reports by querying the synchronously replicated standby RDS MySQL instance maintained  through Multi-AZ.
 C.  Launch a RDS Read Replica connected to your Multi AZ master database and generate reports by querying  the Read Replica. 
 D.  Generate the reports by querying the ElastiCache database caching tier.
answers: C.
Explanation: Amazon RDS allows you to use read replicas with Multi-AZ deployments. In Multi-AZ deployments for MySQL, Oracle, SQL Server, and PostgreSQL, the data in your primary DB Instance is synchronously replicated to to a standby instance in a different Availability Zone (AZ). Because of their synchronous replication, Multi-AZ deployments for these engines offer greater data durability benefits than do read replicas. (In all Amazon RDS for Aurora deployments, your data is automatically replicated across 3 Availability Zones.) You can use Multi-AZ deployments and read replicas in conjunction to enjoy the complementary benefits of each. You can simply specify that a given Multi-AZ deployment is the source DB Instance for your Read replicas. That way you gain both the data durability and availability benefits of Multi-AZ deployments and the read scaling benefits of read replicas. Note that for Multi-AZ deployments, you have the option to create your read replica in an AZ other than that of the primary and the standby for even more redundancy. You can identify the AZ corresponding to your standby by looking at the “Secondary Zone” field of your DB Instance in the AWS Management Console.

Question444: Your customer is willing to consolidate their log streams (access logs application logs security logs etc.) in one single system. Once consolidated, the customer wants to analyze these logs in real time based on heuristics. From time to time, the customer needs to validate heuristics, which requires going back to data samples extracted from the last 12 hours? What is the best approach to meet your customer’s requirements?
 A.  Send all the log events to Amazon SQS. Setup an Auto Scaling group of EC2 servers to consume the logs  and apply the heuristics.
 B.  Send all the log events to Amazon Kinesis develop a client process to apply heuristics on the logs 
 C.  Configure Amazon Cloud Trail to receive custom logs, use EMR to apply heuristics the logs
 D.  Setup an Auto Scaling group of EC2 syslogd servers, store the logs on S3 use EMR to apply heuristics on  the logs
answers: B.
Explanation: The throughput of an Amazon Kinesis stream is designed to scale without limits via increasing the number of shards within a stream. However, there are certain limits you should keep in mind while using Amazon Kinesis Streams: By default, Records of a stream are accessible for up to 24 hours from the time they are added to the stream. You can raise this limit to up to 7 days by enabling extended data retention. The maximum size of a data blob (the data payload before Base64-encoding) within one record is 1 megabyte (MB). Each shard can support up to 1000 PUT records per second. For more information about other API level limits, see Amazon Kinesis Streams Limits.

Question445: You are looking to migrate your Development (Dev) and Test environments to AWS. You have decided to use separate AWS accounts to host each environment.

 D.  Link the accounts using Consolidated Billing. This will give IAM users in the Master account access to  resources in the Dev and Test accounts
answers: C.
Explanation: Bucket Owner Granting Cross-account Permission to objects It Does Not Own In this example scenario, you own a bucket and you have enabled other AWS accounts to upload objects. That is, your bucket can have objects that other AWS accounts own. Now, suppose as a bucket owner, you need to grant cross-account permission on objects, regardless of who the owner is, to a user in another account. For example, that user could be a billing application that needs to access object metadata. There are two core issues: The bucket owner has no permissions on those objects created by other AWS accounts. So for the bucket owner to grant permissions on objects it does not own, the object owner, the AWS account that created the objects, must first grant permission to the bucket owner. The bucket owner can then delegate those permissions. Bucket owner account can delegate permissions to users in its own account but it cannot delegate permissions to other AWS accounts, because cross-account delegation is not supported. In this scenario, the bucket owner can create an AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) role with permission to access objects, and grant another AWS account permission to assume the role temporarily enabling it to access objects in the bucket. Background: Cross-Account Permissions and Using IAM Roles IAM roles enable several scenarios to delegate access to your resources, and cross-account access is one of the key scenarios. In this example, the bucket owner, Account A, uses an IAM role to temporarily delegate object access cross-account to users in another AWS account, Account C. Each IAM role you create has two policies attached to it: A trust policy identifying another AWS account that can assume the role. An access policy defining what permissions—for example, s3:GetObject—are allowed when someone assumes the role. For a list of permissions you can specify in a policy, see Specifying Permissions in a Policy. The AWS account identified in the trust policy then grants its user permission to assume the role. The user can then do the following to access objects: Assume the role and, in response, get temporary security credentials. Using the temporary security credentials, access the objects in the bucket. For more information about IAM roles, go to Roles (Delegation and Federation) in IAM User Guide. The following is a summary of the walkthrough steps:
 
 Account A administrator user attaches a bucket policy granting Account B conditional permission to upload objects. Account A administrator creates an IAM role, establishing trust with Account C, so users in that account can access Account A. The access policy attached to the role limits what user in Account C can do when the user accesses Account A. Account B administrator uploads an object to the bucket owned by Account A, granting full-control permission to the bucket owner. Account C administrator creates a user and attaches a user policy that allows the user to assume the role. User in Account C first assumes the role, which returns the user temporary security credentials. Using those temporary credentials, the user then accesses objects in the bucket. For this example, you need three accounts. The following table shows how we refer to these accounts and the administrator users in these accounts. Per IAM guidelines (see About Using an Administrator User to Create Resources and Grant Permissions) we do not use the account root credentials in this walkthrough. Instead, you create an administrator user in each account and use those credentials in creating resources and granting them permissions

Explanation: Granting Cross-account Permission to objects It Does Not Own In this example scenario, you own a bucket and you have enabled other AWS accounts to upload objects. That is, your bucket can have objects that other AWS accounts own. Now, suppose as a bucket owner, you need to grant cross-account permission on objects, regardless of who the owner is, to a user in another account. For example, that user could be a billing application that needs to access object metadata. There are two core issues: The bucket owner has no permissions on those objects created by other AWS accounts. So for the bucket owner to grant permissions on objects it does not own, the object owner, the AWS account that created the objects, must first grant permission to the bucket owner. The bucket owner can then delegate those permissions. Bucket owner account can delegate permissions to users in its own account but it cannot delegate permissions to other AWS accounts, because cross-account delegation is not supported. In this scenario, the bucket owner can create an AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) role with permission to access objects, and grant another AWS account permission to assume the role temporarily enabling it to access objects in the bucket. Background: Cross-Account Permissions and Using IAM Roles IAM roles enable several scenarios to delegate access to your resources, and cross-account access is one of the key scenarios. In this example, the bucket owner, Account A, uses an IAM role to temporarily delegate object access cross-account to users in another AWS account, Account C. Each IAM role you create has two policies attached to it: A trust policy identifying another AWS account that can assume the role. An access policy defining what permissions—for example, s3:GetObject—are allowed when someone assumes the role. For a list of permissions you can specify in a policy, see Specifying Permissions in a Policy. The AWS account identified in the trust policy then grants its user permission to assume the role. The user can then do the following to access objects: Assume the role and, in response, get temporary security credentials. Using the temporary security credentials, access the objects in the bucket. For more information about IAM roles, go to Roles (Delegation and Federation) in IAM User Guide. The following is a summary of the walkthrough steps:
 
 Account A administrator user attaches a bucket policy granting Account B conditional permission to upload objects. Account A administrator creates an IAM role, establishing trust with Account C, so users in that account can access Account A. The access policy attached to the role limits what user in Account C can do when the user accesses Account A. Account B administrator uploads an object to the bucket owned by Account A, granting full-control permission to the bucket owner. Account C administrator creates a user and attaches a user policy that allows the user to assume the role. User in Account C first assumes the role, which returns the user temporary security credentials. Using those temporary credentials, the user then accesses objects in the bucket. For this example, you need three accounts. The following table shows how we refer to these accounts and the administrator users in these accounts. Per IAM guidelines (see About Using an Administrator User to Create Resources and Grant Permissions) we do not use the account root credentials in this walkthrough. Instead, you create an administrator user in each account and use those credentials in creating resources and granting them permissions

answers: C.
Explanation: Using Reduced Redundancy Storage Amazon S3 stores objects according to their storage class. It assigns the storage class to an object when it is written to Amazon S3. You can assign objects a specific storage class (standard or reduced redundancy) only when you write the objects to an Amazon S3 bucket or when you copy objects that are already stored in Amazon S3. Standard is the default storage class. For information about storage classes, see Object Key and Metadata. In order to reduce storage costs, you can use reduced redundancy storage for noncritical, reproducible data at lower levels of redundancy than Amazon S3 provides with standard storage. The lower level of redundancy results in less durability and availability, but in many cases, the lower costs can make reduced redundancy storage an acceptable storage solution. For example, it can be a cost-effective solution for sharing media content that is durably stored elsewhere. It can also make sense if you are storing thumbnails and other resized images that can be easily reproduced from an original image. Reduced redundancy storage is designed to provide 99.99% durability of objects over a given year. This durability level corresponds to an average annual expected loss of 0.01% of objects. For example, if you store 10,000 objects using the RRS option, you can, on average, expect to incur an annual loss of a single object per year (0.01% of 10,000 objects). Note This annual loss represents an expected average and does not guarantee the loss of less than 0.01% of objects in a given year. Reduced redundancy storage stores objects on multiple devices across multiple facilities, providing 400 times the durability of a typical disk drive, but it does not replicate objects as many times as Amazon S3 standard storage. In addition, reduced redundancy storage is designed to sustain the loss of data in a single facility. If an object in reduced redundancy storage has been lost, Amazon S3 will return a 405 error on requests made to that object. Amazon S3 also offers notifications for reduced redundancy storage object loss: you can configure your bucket so that when Amazon S3 detects the loss of an RRS object, a notification will be sent through Amazon Simple Notification Service (Amazon SNS). You can then replace the lost object. To enable notifications, you can use the Amazon S3 console to set the Notifications property of your bucket.

Question479: You’re running an application on-premises due to its dependency on non-x86 hardware and want to use AWS for data backup. Your backup application is only able to write to POSIX-compatible block-based storage. You have 140TB of data and would like to mount it as a single folder on your file server Users must be able toaccess portions of this data while the backups are taking place. What backup solution would be most appropriate for this use case?
 A.  Use Storage Gateway and configure it to use Gateway Cached volumes.
 B.  Configure your backup software to use S3 as the target for your data backups.
 C.  Configure your backup software to use Glacier as the target for your data backups.
 D.  Use Storage Gateway and configure it to use Gateway Stored volumes.
answers: A.
Explanation: Gateway-Cached Volume Architecture Gateway-cached volumes let you use Amazon Simple Storage Service (Amazon S3) as your primary data storage while retaining frequently accessed data locally in your storage gateway. Gateway-cached volumes minimize the need to scale your on-premises storage infrastructure, while still providing your applications with low-latency access to their frequently accessed data. You can create storage volumes up to 32 TiB in size and attach to them as iSCSI devices from your on-premises application servers. Your gateway stores data that you write to these volumes in Amazon S3 and retains recently read data in your on-premises storage gateway’s cache and upload buffer storage. Gateway-cached volumes can range from 1 GiB to 32 TiB in size and must be rounded to the nearest GiB. Each gateway configured for gateway-cached volumes can support up to 32 volumes for a total maximum storage volume of 1,024 TiB (1 PiB). In the gateway-cached volume solution, AWS Storage Gateway stores all your on-premises application data in a storage volume in Amazon S3. The following diagram provides an overview of the AWS Storage Gateway-cached volume deployment.
 
 After you’ve installed the AWS Storage Gateway software appliance—the virtual machine (VM)—on a host in your data center and activated it, you can use the AWS Management Console to provision storage volumes backed by Amazon S3. You can also provision storage volumes programmatically using the AWS Storage Gateway API or the AWS SDK libraries. You then mount these storage volumes to your on-premises application servers as iSCSI devices. You also allocate disks on-premises for the VM. These on-premises disks serve the following purposes: Disks for use by the gateway as cache storage – As your applications write data to the storage volumes in AWS, the gateway initially stores the data on the on-premises disks referred to as cache storage before uploading the data to Amazon S3. The cache storage acts as the on-premises durable store for data that is waiting to upload to Amazon S3 from the upload buffer.The cache storage also lets the gateway store your application’s recently accessed data on-premises for lowlatency access. If your application requests data, the gateway first checks the cache storage for the data before checking Amazon S3. You can use the following guidelines to determine the amount of disk space to allocate for cache storage. Generally, you should allocate at least 20 percent of your existing file store size as cache storage. Cache storage should also be larger than the upload buffer. This latter guideline helps ensure cache storage is large enough to persistently hold all data in the upload buffer that has not yet been uploaded to Amazon S3. Disks for use by the gateway as the upload buffer – To prepare for upload to Amazon S3, your gateway also stores incoming data in a staging area, referred to as an upload buffer. Your gateway uploads this buffer data over an encrypted Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) connection to AWS, where it is stored encrypted in Amazon S3. You can take incremental backups, called snapshots, of your storage volumes in Amazon S3. These point-intime snapshots are also stored in Amazon S3 as Amazon EBS snapshots. When you take a new snapshot, only the data that has changed since your last snapshot is stored. You can initiate snapshots on a scheduled or one-time basis. When you delete a snapshot, only the data not needed for any other snapshots is removed. You can restore an Amazon EBS snapshot to a gateway storage volume if you need to recover a backup of your data. Alternatively, for snapshots up to 16 TiB in size, you can use the snapshot as a starting point for a new Amazon EBS volume. You can then attach this new Amazon EBS volume to an Amazon EC2 instance. All gateway-cached volume data and snapshot data is stored in Amazon S3 encrypted at rest using server-side encryption (SSE). However, you cannot access this data with the Amazon S3 API or other tools such as the Amazon S3 console.

 E.  Use a CloudFront download distribution to serve the JPEGs to the end users and Install the current  commercial search product, along with a Java Container Tor the website on EC2 instances and useRoute53 with DNS round-robin.
answers: C.
Explanation: There is no such thing as “Most appropriate” without knowing all your goals. I find your scenarios very fuzzy, since you can obviously mix-n-match between them. I think you should decide by layers instead: Load Balancer Layer: ELB or just DNS, or roll-your-own. (Using DNS+EIPs is slightly cheaper, but less reliable than ELB.) Storage Layer for 17TB of Images: This is the perfect use case for S3. Off-load all the web requests directly to the relevant JPEGs in S3. Your EC2 boxes just generate links to them. If your app already serves it’s own images (not links to images), you might start with EFS. But more than likely, you can just setup a web server to re-write or re-direct all JPEG links to S3 pretty easily. If you use S3, don’t serve directly from the bucket – Serve via a CNAME in domain you control. That way, you can switch in CloudFront easily. EBS will be way more expensive, and you’ll need 2x the drives if you need 2 boxes. Yuck. Consider a smaller storage format. For example, JPEG200 or WebP or other tools might make for smaller images. There is also the DejaVu format from a while back. Cache Layer: Adding CloudFront in front of S3 will help people on the other side of the world — well, possibly. Typical archives follow a power law. The long tail of requests means that most JPEGs won’t be requested enough to be in the cache. So you are only speeding up the most popular objects. You can always wait, and switch in CF later after you know your costs better. (In some cases, it can actually lower costs.) You can also put CloudFront in front of your app, since your archive search results should be fairly static. This will also allow you to run with a smaller instance type, since CF will handle much of the load if you do it right. Database Layer: A few options: Use whatever your current server does for now, and replace with something else down the road. Don’t underestimate this approach, sometimes it’s better to start now and optimize later. Use RDS to run MySQL/Postgres I’m not as familiar with ElasticSearch / Cloudsearch, but obviously Cloudsearch will be less maintenance +setup. App Layer: When creating the app layer from scratch, consider CloudFormation and/or OpsWorks. It’s extra stuff to learn, but helps down the road. Java+Tomcat is right up the alley of ElasticBeanstalk. (Basically EC2 + Autoscale + ELB). Preventing Abuse: When you put something in a public S3 bucket, people will hot-link it from their web pages. If you want to prevent that, your app on the EC2 box can generate signed links to S3 that expire in a few hours. Now everyone will be forced to go thru the app, and the app can apply rate limiting, etc. Saving money: If you don’t mind having downtime: run everything in one AZ (both DBs and EC2s). You can always add servers and AZs down the road, as long as it’s architected to be stateless. In fact, you should use multiple regions if you want it to be really robust. use Reduced Redundancy in S3 to save a few hundred bucks per month (Someone will have to “go fix it” every time it breaks, including having an off-line copy to repair S3.) Buy Reserved Instances on your EC2 boxes to make them cheaper. (Start with the RI market and buy a partially used one to get started.) It’s just a coupon saying “if you run this type of box in this AZ, you will save on the per-hour costs.” You can get 1/2 to 1/3 off easily. Rewrite the application to use less memory and CPU – that way you can run on fewer/smaller boxes. (May or may not be worth the investment.) If your app will be used very infrequently, you will save a lot of money by using Lambda. I’d be worried that it would be quite slow if you tried to run a Java application on it though. We’re missing some information like load, latency expectations from search, indexing speed, size of the search index, etc. But with what you’ve given us, I would go with S3 as the storage for the files (S3 rocks. It is really, really awesome). If you’re stuck with the commercial search application, then on EC2 instances with autoscaling and an ELB. If you are allowed an alternative search engine, Elasticsearch is probably your best bet. I’d run it on EC2 instead of the AWS Elasticsearch service, as IMHO it’s not ready yet. Don’t autoscale Elasticsearch automatically though, it’ll cause all sorts of issues. I have zero experience with CloudSearch so ic an’t comment on that. Regardless of which option, I’d use CloudFormation for all of it.

Question485: You are migrating a legacy client-server application to AWS. The application responds to a specific DNS domain (e.g. www.example.com) and has a 2-tier architecture, with multiple application servers and a database server. Remote clients use TCP to connect to the application servers. The application servers need to know the IP address of the clients in order to function properly and are currently taking that information from the TCP socket. A Multi-AZ RDS MySQL instance will be used for the database. During the migration you can change the application code, but you have to file a change request. How would you implement the architecture on AWS in order to maximize scalability and high availability?
 A.  File a change request to implement Alias Resource support in the application. Use Route 53 Alias Resource  Record to distribute load on two application servers in different AZs.
 B.  File a change request to implement Latency Based Routing support in the application. Use Route 53 with  Latency Based Routing enabled to distribute load on two application servers in different AZs.
 C.  File a change request to implement Cross-Zone support in the application. Use an ELB with a TCP Listener  and Cross-Zone Load Balancing enabled, two application servers in different AZs.
 D.  File a change request to implement Proxy Protocol support in the application. Use an ELB with a TCP  Listener and Proxy Protocol enabled to distribute load on two application servers in different AZs.
answers: D.

Explanation: AWS Direct Connect AWS Direct Connect makes it easy to establish a dedicated network connection from your premises to AWS. Using AWS Direct Connect, you can establish private connectivity between AWS and your datacenter, office, or colocation environment, which in many cases can reduce your network costs, increase bandwidth throughput, and provide a more consistent network experience than Internet-based connections. AWS Direct Connect lets you establish a dedicated network connection between your network and one of the AWS Direct Connect locations. Using industry standard 802.1q VLANs, this dedicated connection can be partitioned into multiple virtual interfaces. This allows you to use the same connection to access public resources such as objects stored in Amazon S3 using public IP address space, and private resources such as Amazon EC2 instances running within an Amazon Virtual Private Cloud (VPC) using private IP space, while maintaining network separation between the public and private environments. Virtual interfaces can be reconfigured at any time to meet your changing needs. What is AWS Direct Connect? AWS Direct Connect links your internal network to an AWS Direct Connect location over a standard 1 gigabit or 10 gigabit Ethernet fiber-optic cable. One end of the cable is connected to your router, the other to an AWS Direct Connect router. With this connection in place, you can create virtual interfaces directly to the AWS cloud (for example, to Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (Amazon EC2) and Amazon Simple Storage Service (Amazon S3)) and to Amazon Virtual Private Cloud (Amazon VPC), bypassing Internet service providers in your network path. An AWS Direct Connect location provides access to Amazon Web Services in the region it is associated with, as well as access to other US regions. For example, you can provision a single connection to any AWS Direct Connect location in the US and use it to access public AWS services in all US Regions and AWS GovCloud (US). The following diagram shows how AWS Direct Connect interfaces with your network.
 
 Requirements To use AWS Direct Connect, your network must meet one of the following conditions: Your network is colocated with an existing AWS Direct Connect location. For more information on available AWS Direct Connect locations, go to http://aws.amazon.com/directconnect/. You are working with an AWS Direct Connect partner who is a member of the AWS Partner Network (APN). For a list of AWS Direct Connect partners who can help you connect, go to http://aws.amazon.com/ direct connect. You are working with an independent service provider to connect to AWS Direct Connect. In addition, your network must meet the following conditions: Connections to AWS Direct Connect require single mode fiber, 1000BASE-LX (1310nm) for 1 gigabit Ethernet, or 10GBASE-LR (1310nm) for 10 gigabit Ethernet. Auto Negotiation for the port must be disabled. You mustsupport 802.1Q VLANs across these connections. Your network must support Border Gateway Protocol (BGP) and BGP MD5 authentication. Optionally, you may configure Bidirectional Forwarding Detection (BFD). To connect to Amazon Virtual Private Cloud (Amazon VPC), you must first do the following: Provide a private Autonomous System Number (ASN). Amazon allocates a private IP address in the 169.x.x.x range to you. Create a virtual private gateway and attach it to your VPC. For more information about creating a virtual private gateway, see Adding a Hardware Virtual Private Gateway to Your VPC in the Amazon VPC User Guide. To connect to public AWS products such as Amazon EC2 and Amazon S3, you need to provide the following: A public ASN that you own (preferred) or a private ASN. Public IP addresses (/31) (that is, one for each end of the BGP session) for each BGP session. If you do not have public IP addresses to assign to this connection, log on to AWS and then open a ticket with AWS Support. The public routes that you will advertise over BGP.

Question487: You are designing Internet connectivity for your VPC. The Web servers must be available on the Internet. The application must have a highly available architecture. Which alternatives should you consider? (Choose two.)
 A.  Configure a NAT instance in your VPC. Create a default route via the NAT instance and associate it with all  subnets. Configure a DNS A record that points to the NAT instance public IP address.
 B.  Configure a CloudFront distribution and configure the origin to point to the private IP addresses of your Web  servers. Configure a Route53 CNAME record to your CloudFront distribution.
 C.  Place all your web servers behind EL8. Configure a Route53 CNMIE to point to the ELB DNS name. 
 D.  Assign EIPs to all web servers. Configure a Route53 record set with all EIPs with health checks and DNS  failover. 
 E.  Configure ELB with an EIP. Place all your Web servers behind ELB. Configure a Route53 A record that  points to the EIP.

 D.  Create an IAM user and apply an IAM role which prevents users from terminating production EC2 instances.
answers: B.
Explanation: Working with volumes When an API action requires a caller to specify multiple resources, you must create a policy statement that allows users to access all required resources. If you need to use a Condition element with one or more of these resources, you must create multiple statements as shown in this example. The following policy allows users to attach volumes with the tag “volume_user=iam-user-name” to instances with the tag “department=dev”, and to detach those volumes from those instances. If you attach this policy to an IAM group, the aws:username policy variable gives each IAM user in the group permission to attach or detach volumes from the instances with a tag named volume_user that has his or her IAM user name as a value. { “Version”: “2012-10-17”, “Statement”: [{ “Effect”: “Allow”, “Action”: [ “ec2:AttachVolume”, “ec2:DetachVolume” ], “Resource”: “arn:aws:ec2:us-east-1:123456789012:instance/*”, “Condition”: { “StringEquals”: { “ec2:ResourceTag/department”: “dev” }} }, { “Effect”: “Allow”, “Action”: [ “ec2:AttachVolume”, “ec2:DetachVolume” ], “Resource”: “arn:aws:ec2:us-east-1:123456789012:volume/*”, “Condition”: { “StringEquals”: { “ec2:ResourceTag/volume_user”: “${aws:username}” } } } ] } Launching instances (RunInstances) The RunInstances API action launches one or more instances. RunInstances requires an AMI and creates an instance; and users can specify a key pair and security group in the request. Launching into EC2-VPC requires a subnet, and creates a network interface. Launching from an Amazon EBS-backed AMI creates a volume. Therefore, the user must have permission to use these Amazon EC2 resources. The caller can also configure the instance using optional parameters to RunInstances, such as the instance type and a subnet. You can create a policy statement that requires users to specify an optional parameter, or restricts users to particular values for a parameter. The examples in this section demonstrate some of the many possible ways that you can control the configuration of an instance that a user can launch. Note that by default, users don’t have permission to describe, start, stop, or terminate the resulting instances. One way to grant the users permission to manage the resulting instances is to create a specific tag for each instance, and then create a statement that enables them to manage instances with that tag. For more information, see 2: Working with instances. a AMI The following policy allows users to launch instances using only the AMIs that have the specified tag, “department=dev”, associated with them. The users can’t launch instances using other AMIs because the Condition element of the first statement requires that users specify an AMI that has this tag. The users also can’t launch into a subnet, as the policy does not grant permissions for the subnet and network interface resources. They can, however, launch into EC2-Classic. The second statement uses a wildcard to enable users to create instance resources, and requires users to specify the key pair project_keypair and the security group sg-1a2b3c4d. Users are still able to launch instances without a key pair. { “Version”: “2012-10-17”, “Statement”: [{ “Effect”: “Allow”, “Action”: “ec2:RunInstances”, “Resource”: [ “arn:aws:ec2:region::image/ami-*” ], “Condition”: { “StringEquals”: { “ec2:ResourceTag/department”: “dev” } } }, { “Effect”: “Allow”, “Action”: “ec2:RunInstances”, “Resource”: [ “arn:aws:ec2:region:account:instance/*”, “arn:aws:ec2:region:account:volume/*”, “arn:aws:ec2:region:account:key-pair/project_keypair”, “arn:aws:ec2:region:account:security-group/sg-1a2b3c4d”] } ] } Alternatively, the following policy allows users to launch instances using only the specified AMIs, ami-9e1670f7 and ami-45cf5c3c. The users can’t launch an instance using other AMIs (unless another statement grants the users permission to do so), and the users can’t launch an instance into a subnet. { “Version”: “2012-10-17”, “Statement”: [{ “Effect”: “Allow”, “Action”: “ec2:RunInstances”, “Resource”: [ “arn:aws:ec2:region::image/ami-9e1670f7”, “arn:aws:ec2:region::image/ami-45cf5c3c”, “arn:aws:ec2:region:account:instance/*”, “arn:aws:ec2:region:account:volume/*”, “arn:aws:ec2:region:account:key-pair/*”, “arn:aws:ec2:region:account:security-group/*” ] } ] } Alternatively, the following policy allows users to launch instances from all AMIs owned by Amazon. The Condition element of the first statement tests whether ec2:Owner is amazon. The users can’t launch an instance using other AMIs (unless another statement grants the users permission to do so). The users are able to launch an instance into a subnet. { “Version”: “2012-10-17”, “Statement”: [{ “Effect”: “Allow”, “Action”: “ec2:RunInstances”, “Resource”: [ “arn:aws:ec2:region::image/ami-*” ], “Condition”: { “StringEquals”: { “ec2:Owner”: “amazon” } } }, { “Effect”: “Allow”, “Action”: “ec2:RunInstances”, “Resource”: [ “arn:aws:ec2:region:account:instance/*”, “arn:aws:ec2:region:account:subnet/*”, “arn:aws:ec2:region:account:volume/*”, “arn:aws:ec2:region:account:network-interface/*”, “arn:aws:ec2:region:account:key-pair/*”, “arn:aws:ec2:region:account:security-group/*” ] } ] } b. Instance type The following policy allows users to launch instances using only the t2.micro or t2.small instance type, which you might do to control costs. The users can’t launch larger instances because the Condition element of the first statement tests whether ec2:InstanceType is either t2.micro or t2.small. {“Version”: “2012-10-17”, “Statement”: [{ “Effect”: “Allow”, “Action”: “ec2:RunInstances”, “Resource”: [ “arn:aws:ec2:region:account:instance/*” ], “Condition”: { “StringEquals”: { “ec2:InstanceType”: [“t2.micro”, “t2.small”] } } }, { “Effect”: “Allow”, “Action”: “ec2:RunInstances”, “Resource”: [ “arn:aws:ec2:region::image/ami-*”, “arn:aws:ec2:region:account:subnet/*”, “arn:aws:ec2:region:account:network-interface/*”, “arn:aws:ec2:region:account:volume/*”, “arn:aws:ec2:region:account:key-pair/*”, “arn:aws:ec2:region:account:security-group/*” ] } ] } Alternatively, you can create a policy that denies users permission to launch any instances except t2.micro and t2.small instance types. { “Version”: “2012-10-17”, “Statement”: [{ “Effect”: “Deny”, “Action”: “ec2:RunInstances”, “Resource”: [ “arn:aws:ec2:region:account:instance/*” ], “Condition”: { “StringNotEquals”: { “ec2:InstanceType”: [“t2.micro”, “t2.small”] } } }, { “Effect”: “Allow”, “Action”: “ec2:RunInstances”, “Resource”: [ “arn:aws:ec2:region::image/ami-*”, “arn:aws:ec2:region:account:network-interface/*”, “arn:aws:ec2:region:account:instance/*”, “arn:aws:ec2:region:account:subnet/*”, “arn:aws:ec2:region:account:volume/*”, “arn:aws:ec2:region:account:key-pair/*”, “arn:aws:ec2:region:account:security-group/*” ] } ] } c. Subnet The following policy allows users to launch instances using only the specified subnet, subnet-12345678. Thegroup can’t launch instances into any another subnet (unless another statement grants the users permission to do so). Users are still able to launch instances into EC2-Classic. { “Version”: “2012-10-17”, “Statement”: [{ “Effect”: “Allow”, “Action”: “ec2:RunInstances”, “Resource”: [ “arn:aws:ec2:region:account:subnet/subnet-12345678”, “arn:aws:ec2:region:account:network-interface/*”, “arn:aws:ec2:region:account:instance/*”, “arn:aws:ec2:region:account:volume/*”, “arn:aws:ec2:region::image/ami-*”, “arn:aws:ec2:region:account:key-pair/*”, “arn:aws:ec2:region:account:security-group/*” ] } ] } Alternatively, you could create a policy that denies users permission to launch an instance into any other subnet. The statement does this by denying permission to create a network interface, except where subnet subnet-12345678 is specified. This denial overrides any other policies that are created to allow launching instances into other subnets. Users are still able to launch instances into EC2-Classic. { “Version”: “2012-10-17”, “Statement”: [{ “Effect”: “Deny”, “Action”: “ec2:RunInstances”, “Resource”: [ “arn:aws:ec2:region:account:network-interface/*” ], “Condition”: { “ArnNotEquals”: { “ec2:Subnet”: “arn:aws:ec2:region:account:subnet/subnet-12345678” } } }, { “Effect”: “Allow”, “Action”: “ec2:RunInstances”, “Resource”: [ “arn:aws:ec2:region::image/ami-*”, “arn:aws:ec2:region:account:network-interface/*”, “arn:aws:ec2:region:account:instance/*”, “arn:aws:ec2:region:account:subnet/*”, “arn:aws:ec2:region:account:volume/*”, “arn:aws:ec2:region:account:key-pair/*”, “arn:aws:ec2:region:account:security-group/*” ] } ] } https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/security/resource-level-permissions-for-ec2-controlling-management-access-onspecific-instances/ *August 2016 Update* One way to work around this is to use a combination of an Amazon CloudWatch Events rule and AWS Lambda to tag newly created instances.

Question497: You have deployed a web application targeting a global audience across multiple AWS Regions under the domain name.example.com. You decide to use Route53 Latency-Based Routing to serve web requests to users from the region closest to the user. To provide business continuity in the event of server downtime you configure weighted record sets associated with two web servers in separate Availability Zones per region. Running a DR test you notice that when you disable all web servers in one of the regions Route53 does not automatically direct all users to the other region. What could be happening? (Choose two.)
 A.  Latency resource record sets cannot be used in combination with weighted resource record sets.
 B.  You did not setup an HTTP health check tor one or more of the weighted resource record sets associated  with me disabled web servers. 
 C.  The value of the weight associated with the latency alias resource record set in the region with the disabled  servers is higher than the weight for the other region.
 D.  One of the two working web servers in the other region did not pass its HTTP health check.
 E.  You did not set “Evaluate Target Health” to “Yes” on the latency alias resource record set associated withexample com in the region where you disabled the servers.
answers: B. 
 E.
Explanation: How Health Checks Work in Complex Amazon Route 53 Configurations Checking the health of resources in complex configurations works much the same way as in simple configurations. However, in complex configurations, you use a combination of alias resource record sets (including weighted alias, latency alias, and failover alias) and nonalias resource record sets to build a decision tree that gives you greater control over how Amazon Route 53 responds to requests. For more information, see How Health Checks Work in Simple Amazon Route 53 Configurations. For example, you might use latency alias resource record sets to select a region close to a user and use weighted resource record sets for two or more resources within each region to protect against the failure of a single endpoint or an Availability Zone. The following diagram shows this configuration.
 
 Here’s how Amazon EC2 and Amazon Route 53 are configured: You have Amazon EC2 instances in two regions, us-east-1 and ap-southeast-2. You want Amazon Route 53 to respond to queries by using the resource record sets in the region that provides the lowest latency for your customers, so you create a latency alias resource record set for each region. (You create the latency alias resource record sets after you create resource record sets for the individual Amazon EC2 instances.) Within each region, you have two Amazon EC2 instances. You create a weighted resource record set for each instance. The name and the type are the same for both of the weighted resource record sets in each region. When you have multiple resources in a region, you can create weighted or failover resource record sets for your resources. You can also create even more complex configurations by creating weighted alias or failover alias resource record sets that, in turn, refer to multiple resources. Each weighted resource record set has an associated health check. The IP address for each health check matches the IP address for the corresponding resource record set. This isn’t required, but it’s the most common configuration. For both latency alias resource record sets, you set the value of Evaluate Target Health to Yes. You use the Evaluate Target Health setting for each latency alias resource record set to make Amazon Route 53 evaluate the health of the alias targets—the weighted resource record sets—and respond accordingly.
 
 The preceding diagram illustrates the following sequence of events: Amazon Route 53 receives a query for example.com. Based on the latency for the user making the request, Amazon Route 53 selects the latency alias resource record set for the us-east-1 region. Amazon Route 53 selects a weighted resource record set based on weight. Evaluate Target Health is Yes for the latency alias resource record set, so Amazon Route 53 checks the health of the selected weighted resource record set. The health check failed, so Amazon Route 53 chooses another weighted resource record set based on weight and checks its health. That resource record set also is unhealthy. Amazon Route 53 backs out of that branch of the tree, looks for the latency alias resource record set with the next-best latency, and chooses the resource record set for ap-southeast-2. Amazon Route 53 again selects a resource record set based on weight, and then checks the health of the selected resource record set. The health check passed, so Amazon Route 53 returns the applicable value in response to the query. What Happens When You Associate a Health Check with an Alias Resource Record Set? You can associate a health check with an alias resource record set instead of or in addition to setting the value of Evaluate Target Health to Yes. However, it’s generally more useful if Amazon Route 53 responds to queries based on the health of the underlying resources—the HTTP servers, database servers, and other resources that your alias resource record sets refer to. For example, suppose the following configuration: You assign a health check to a latency alias resource record set for which the alias target is a group of weighted resource record sets. You set the value of Evaluate Target Health to Yes for the latency alias resource record set. In this configuration, both of the following must be true before Amazon Route 53 will return the applicable value for a weighted resource record set: The health check associated with the latency alias resource record set must pass. At least one weighted resource record set must be considered healthy, either because it’s associated with a health check that passes or because it’s not associated with a health check. In the latter case, Amazon Route 53 always considers the weighted resource record set healthy.
 
 If the health check for the latency alias resource record set fails, Amazon Route 53 stops responding to queries using any of the weighted resource record sets in the alias target, even if they’re all healthy. Amazon Route 53 doesn’t know the status of the weighted resource record sets because it never looks past the failed health check on the alias resource record set. What Happens When You Omit Health Checks? In a complex configuration, it’s important to associate health checks with all of the non-alias resource record sets. Let’s return to the preceding example, but assume that a health check is missing on one of the weighted resource record sets in the us-east-1 region:
 
 Here’s what happens when you omit a health check on a non-alias resource record set in this configuration: Amazon Route 53 receives a query for example.com. Based on the latency for the user making the request, Amazon Route 53 selects the latency alias resource record set for the us-east-1 region. Amazon Route 53 looks up the alias target for the latency alias resource record set, and checks the status of the corresponding health checks. The health check for one weighted resource record set failed, so that resource record set is omitted from consideration. The other weighted resource record set in the alias target for the us-east-1 region has no health check. The corresponding resource might or might not be healthy, but without a health check, Amazon Route 53 has no way to know. Amazon Route 53 assumes that the resource is healthy and returns the applicable value in response to the query. What Happens When You Set Evaluate Target Health to No? In general, you also want to set Evaluate Target Health to Yes for all of the alias resource record sets. In the following example, all of the weighted resource record sets have associated health checks, but Evaluate Target Health is set to No for the latency alias resource record set for the us-east-1 region:
 
 Here’s what happens when you set Evaluate Target Health to No for an alias resource record set in this configuration: Amazon Route 53 receives a query for example.com. Based on the latency for the user making the request, Amazon Route 53 selects the latency alias resource record set for the us-east-1 region. Amazon Route 53 determines what the alias target is for the latency alias resource record set, and checks the corresponding health checks. They’re both failing. Because the value of Evaluate Target Health is No for the latency alias resource record set for the us-east-1 region, Amazon Route 53 must choose one resource record set in this branch instead of backing out of the branch and looking for a healthy resource record set in the ap-southeast-2 region.

Question500: Your company currently has a 2-tier web application running in an on-premises data center. You have experienced several infrastructure failures in the past two months resulting in significant financial losses. Your CIO is strongly agreeing to move the application to AWS. While working on achieving buy-in from the other company executives, he asks you to develop a disaster recovery plan to help improve Business continuity in the short term. He specifies a target Recovery Time Objective (RTO) of 4 hours and a Recovery Point Objective (RPO) of 1 hour or less. He also asks you to implement the solution within 2 weeks. Your database is 200GB insize and you have a 20Mbps Internet connection. How would you do this while minimizing costs?
 A.  Create an EBS backed private AMI which includes a fresh install of your application. Develop a  CloudFormation template which includes your AMI and the required EC2, AutoScaling, and ELB resources  to support deploying the application across Multiple- Availability-Zones. Asynchronously replicate  transactions from your on-premises database to a database instance in AWS across a secure VPN  connection.
 B.  Deploy your application on EC2 instances within an Auto Scaling group across multiple availability zones.  Asynchronously replicate transactions from your on-premises database to a database instance in AWS  across a secure VPN connection.
 C.  Create an EBS backed private AMI which includes a fresh install of your application. Setup a script in your  data center to backup the local database every 1 hour and to encrypt and copy the resulting file to an S3  bucket using multi-part upload.
 D.  Install your application on a compute-optimized EC2 instance capable of supporting the application’s  average load. Synchronously replicate transactions from your on-premises database to a database instance  in AWS across a secure Direct Connect connection.
answers: A.
Explanation: Overview of Creating Amazon EBS-Backed AMIs First, launch an instance from an AMI that’s similar to the AMI that you’d like to create. You can connect to your instance and customize it. When the instance is configured correctly, ensure data integrity by stopping the instance before you create an AMI, then create the image. When you create an Amazon EBS-backed AMI, we automatically register it for you. Amazon EC2 powers down the instance before creating the AMI to ensure that everything on the instance is stopped and in a consistent state during the creation process. If you’re confident that your instance is in a consistent state appropriate for AMI creation, you can tell Amazon EC2 not to power down and reboot the instance. Some file systems, such as XFS, can freeze and unfreeze activity, making it safe to create the image without rebooting the instance. During the AMI-creation process, Amazon EC2 creates snapshots of your instance’s root volume and any other EBS volumes attached to your instance. If any volumes attached to the instance are encrypted, the new AMI only launches successfully on instances that support Amazon EBS encryption. For more information, see Amazon EBS Encryption. Depending on the size of the volumes, it can take several minutes for the AMI-creation process to complete (sometimes up to 24 hours). You may find it more efficient to create snapshots of your volumes prior to creating your AMI. This way, only small, incremental snapshots need to be created when the AMI is created, and the process completes more quickly (the total time for snapshot creation remains the same). For more information, see Creating an Amazon EBS Snapshot. After the process completes, you have a new AMI and snapshot created from the root volume of the instance. When you launch an instance using the new AMI, we create a new EBS volume for its root volume using the snapshot. Both the AMI and the snapshot incur charges to your account until you delete them. For more information, see Deregistering Your AMI. If you add instance-store volumes or EBS volumes to your instance in addition to the root device volume, the block device mapping for the new AMI contains information for these volumes, and the block device mappings for instances that you launch from the new AMI automatically contain information for these volumes. The instance-store volumes specified in the block device mapping for the new instance are new and don’t contain any data from the instance store volumes of the instance you used to create the AMI. The data on EBS volumes persists. For more information, see Block Device Mapping.

Question501: 
 Refer to the architecture diagram above of a batch processing solution using Simple Queue Service (SQS) to set up a message queue between EC2 instances which are used as batch processors Cloud Watch monitors the number of Job requests (queued messages) and an Auto Scaling group adds or deletes batch servers automatically based on parameters set in Cloud Watch alarms. You can use this architecture to implement which of the following features in a cost effective and efficient manner?
 A.  Reduce the overall lime for executing jobs through parallel processing by allowing a busy EC2 instance that  receives a message to pass it to the next instance in a daisy-chain setup. B.  Implement fault tolerance against EC2 instance failure since messages would remain in SQS and worn can  continue with recovery of EC2 instances implement fault tolerance against SQS failure by backing up  messages to S3.
 C.  Implement message passing between EC2 instances within a batch by exchanging messages through  SQS.
 D.  Coordinate number of EC2 instances with number of job requests automatically thus Improving cost  effectiveness. 
 E.  Handle high priority jobs before lower priority jobs by assigning a priority metadata field to SQS messages.
answers: D.
Explanation: There are cases where a large number of batch jobs may need processing, and where the the jobs may need to be re-prioritized. For example, one such case is one where there are differences between different levels of services for unpaid users versus subscriber users (such as the time until publication) in services enabling, for example, presentation files to be uploaded for publication from a web browser. When the user uploads a presentation file, the conversion processes, for example, for publication are performed as batch processes on the system side, and the file is published after the conversion. Is it then necessary to be able to assign the level of priority to the batch processes for each type of subscriber. Explanation of the Cloud Solution/Pattern A queue is used in controlling batch jobs. The queue need only be provided with priority numbers. Job requests are controlled by the queue, and the job requests in the queue are processed by a batch server. In Cloudcomputing, a highly reliable queue is provided as a service, which you can use to structure a highly reliable batch system with ease. You may prepare multiple queues depending on priority levels, with job requests put into the queues depending on their priority levels, to apply prioritization to batch processes. The performance (number) of batch servers corresponding to a queue must be in accordance with the priority level thereof. Implementation In AWS, the queue service is the Simple Queue Service (SQS). Multiple SQS queues may be prepared to prepare queues for individual priority levels (with a priority queue and a secondary queue). Moreover, you may also use the message Delayed Send function to delay process execution. Use SQS to prepare multiple queues for the individual priority levels. Place those processes to be executed immediately (job requests) in the high priority queue. Prepare numbers of batch servers, for processing the job requests of the queues, depending on the priority levels. Queues have a message “Delayed Send” function. You can use this to delay the time for starting a process. Configuration
 
 Benefits You can increase or decrease the number of servers for processing jobs to change automatically the processing speeds of the priority queues and secondary queues. You can handle performance and service requirements through merely increasing or decreasing the number of EC2 instances used in job processing. Even if an EC2 were to fail, the messages (jobs) would remain in the queue service, enabling processing to be continued immediately upon recovery of the EC2 instance, producing a system that is robust to failure. Cautions Depending on the balance between the number of EC2 instances for performing the processes and the number of messages that are queued, there may be cases where processing in the secondary queue may be completed first, so you need to monitor the processing speeds in the primary queue and the secondary queue.

Question502: An International company has deployed a multi-tier web application that relies on DynamoDB in a single region. For regulatory reasons they need disaster recovery capability In a separate region with a Recovery Time Objective of 2 hours and a Recovery Point Objective of 24 hours They should synchronize their data on a regular basis and be able to provision me web application rapidly using CloudFormation.

Question504: Your application is using an ELB in front of an Auto Scaling group of web/application servers deployed across two AZs and a Multi-AZ RDS Instance for data persistence. The database CPU is often above 80% usage and 90% of I/O operations on the database are reads. To improve performance you recently added a single-node Memcached ElastiCache Cluster to cache frequent DB query results. In the next weeks the overall workload is expected to grow by 30%. Do you need to change anything in the architecture to maintain the high availability or the application with the anticipated additional load? Why?
 A.  Yes, you should deploy two Memcached ElastiCache Clusters in different AZs because the RDS instance  will not be able to handle the load if the cache node fails.
 B.  No, if the cache node fails you can always get the same data from the DB withouthaving any availability  impact.
 C.  No, if the cache node fails the automated ElastiCache node recovery feature will prevent any availability  impact.
 D.  Yes, you should deploy the Memcached ElastiCache Cluster with two nodes in the same AZ as the RDS DB  master instance to handle the load if one cache node fails.
answers: A.
Explanation: ExplanationExplanation/Reference:
 ElastiCache for Memcached The primary goal of caching is typically to offload reads from your database or other primary data source. In most apps, you have hot spots of data that are regularly queried, but only updated periodically. Think of the front page of a blog or news site, or the top 100 leaderboard in an online game. In this type of case, your app can receive dozens, hundreds, or even thousands of requests for the same data before it’s updated again. Having your caching layer handle these queries has several advantages. First, it’s considerably cheaper to add an in-memory cache than to scale up to a larger database cluster. Second, an in-memory cache is also easier to scale out, because it’s easier to distribute an in-memory cache horizontally than a relational database. Last, a caching layer provides a request buffer in the event of a sudden spike in usage. If your app or game ends up on the front page of Reddit or the App Store, it’s not unheard of to see a spike that is 10 to 100 times your normal application load. Even if you autoscale your application instances, a 10x request spike will likely make your database very unhappy. Let’s focus on ElastiCache for Memcached first, because it is the best fit for a cachingfocused solution. We’ll revisit Redis later in the paper, and weigh its advantages and disadvantages. Architecture with ElastiCache for Memcached When you deploy an ElastiCache Memcached cluster, it sits in your application as a separate tier alongside your database. As mentioned previously, Amazon ElastiCache does not directly communicate with your database tier, or indeed have any particular knowledge of your database. A simplified deployment for a web application looks something like this:
 
 In this architecture diagram, the Amazon EC2 application instances are in an Auto Scaling group, located behind a load balancer using Elastic Load Balancing, which distributes requests among the instances. As requests come into a given EC2 instance, that EC2 instance is responsible for communicating with ElastiCache and the database tier. For development purposes, you can begin with a single ElastiCache node to test your application, and then scale to additional cluster nodes by modifying the ElastiCache cluster. As you add additional cache nodes, the EC2 application instances are able to distribute cache keys across multiple ElastiCache nodes. The most common practice is to use client-side sharding to distribute keys across cache nodes, which we will discuss later in this paper.
 
 When you launch an ElastiCache cluster, you can choose the Availability Zone(s) that the cluster lives in. For best performance, you should configure your cluster to use the same Availability Zones as your application servers. To launch an ElastiCache cluster in a specific Availability Zone, make sure to specify the Preferred Zone(s) option during cache cluster creation. The Availability Zones that you specify will be where ElastiCache will launch your cache nodes. We recommend that you select Spread Nodes Across Zones, which tells ElastiCache to distribute cache nodes across these zones as evenly as possible. This distribution will mitigate the impact of an Availability Zone disruption on your ElastiCache nodes. The trade-off is that some of the requests from your application to ElastiCache will go to a node in a different Availability Zone, meaning latency will be slightly higher. For more details, refer to Creating a Cache Cluster in the Amazon ElastiCache User Guide. As mentioned at the outset, ElastiCache can be coupled with a wide variety of databases. Here is an example architecture that uses Amazon DynamoDB instead of Amazon RDS and MySQL:
 
 This combination of DynamoDB and ElastiCache is very popular with mobile and game companies, because DynamoDB allows for higher write throughput at lower cost than traditional relational databases. In addition, DynamoDB uses a key-value access pattern similar to ElastiCache, which also simplifies the programming model. Instead of using relational SQL for the primary database but then key-value patterns for the cache, both the primary database and cache can be programmed similarly. In this architecture pattern, DynamoDB remains the source of truth for data, but application reads are offloaded to ElastiCache for a speed boost.

Question505: Your company runs a customer facing event registration site This site is built with a 3-tier architecture with web and application tier servers and a MySQL database The application requires 6 web tier servers and 6 application tier servers for normal operation, but can run on a minimum of 65% server capacity and a single MySQL database. When deploying this application in a region with three availability zones (AZs) which architecture provides high availability?
 A.  A web tier deployed across 2 AZs with 3 EC2 (Elastic Compute Cloud) instances in each AZ inside an Auto  Scaling Group behind an ELB (elastic load balancer), and an application tier deployed across 2 AZs with 3  EC2 instances in each AZ inside an Auto Scaling Group behind an ELB, and one RDS (Relational Database  Service) instance deployed with read replicas in the other AZ.
 B.  A web tier deployed across 3 AZs with 2 EC2 (Elastic Compute Cloud) instances in each AZ inside an Auto  Scaling Group behind an ELB (elastic load balancer) and an application tier deployed across 3 AZs with 2  EC2 instances in each AZ inside an Auto Scaling Group behind an ELB and one RDS (Relational Database  Service) Instance deployed with read replicas in the two other AZs.
 C.  A web tier deployed across 2 AZs with 3 EC2 (Elastic Compute Cloud) instances in each AZ inside an Auto  Scaling Group behind an ELB (elastic load balancer) and an application tier deployed across 2 AZs with 3  EC2 instances m each AZ inside an Auto Scaling Group behind an ELS and a Multi-AZ RDS (Relational  Database Service) deployment.
 D.  A web tier deployed across 3 AZs with 2 EC2 (Elastic Compute Cloud) instances in each AZ Inside an Auto  Scaling Group behind an ELB (elastic load balancer). And an application tier deployed across 3 AZs with 2  EC2 instances in each AZ inside an Auto Scaling Group behind an ELB. And a Multi-AZ RDS (Relational  Database services) deployment.
answers: D.
Explanation: Amazon RDS Multi-AZ Deployments Amazon RDS Multi-AZ deployments provide enhanced availability and durability for Database (DB) Instances, making them a natural fit for production database workloads. When you provision a Multi-AZ DB Instance, Amazon RDS automatically creates a primary DB Instance and synchronously replicates the data to a standby instance in a different Availability Zone (AZ). Each AZ runs on its own physically distinct, independent infrastructure, and is engineered to be highly reliable. In case of an infrastructure failure (for example, instancehardware failure, storage failure, or network disruption), Amazon RDS performs an automatic failover to the standby, so that you can resume database operations as soon as the failover is complete. Since the endpoint for your DB Instance remains the same after a failover, your application can resume database operation without the need for manual administrative intervention. Enhanced Durability Multi-AZ deployments for the MySQL, Oracle, and PostgreSQL engines utilize synchronous physical replication to keep data on the standby up-to-date with the primary. Multi-AZ deployments for the SQL Server engine use synchronous logical replication to achieve the same result, employing SQL Server-native Mirroring technology. Both approaches safeguard your data in the event of a DB Instance failure or loss of an Availability Zone. If a storage volume on your primary fails in a Multi-AZ deployment, Amazon RDS automatically initiates a failover to the up-to-date standby. Compare this to a Single-AZ deployment: in case of a Single-AZ database failure, a user-initiated point-in-time-restore operation will be required. This operation can take several hours to complete, and any data updates that occurred after the latest restorable time (typically within the last five minutes) will not be available. Amazon Aurora employs a highly durable, SSD-backed virtualized storage layer purpose-built for database workloads. Amazon Aurora automatically replicates your volume six ways, across three Availability Zones. Amazon Aurora storage is fault-tolerant, transparently handling the loss of up to two copies of data without affecting database write availability and up to three copies without affecting read availability. Amazon Aurora storage is also self-healing. Data blocks and disks are continuously scanned for errors and replaced automatically. Increased Availability You also benefit from enhanced database availability when running Multi-AZ deployments. If an Availability Zone failure or DB Instance failure occurs, your availability impact is limited to the time automatic failover takes to complete: typically under one minute for Amazon Aurora and one to two minutes for other database engines (see the RDS FAQ for details). The availability benefits of Multi-AZ deployments also extend to planned maintenance and backups. In the case of system upgrades like OS patching or DB Instance scaling, these operations are applied first on the standby, prior to the automatic failover. As a result, your availability impact is, again, only the time required for automatic failover to complete. Unlike Single-AZ deployments, I/O activity is not suspended on your primary during backup for Multi-AZ deployments for the MySQL, Oracle, and PostgreSQL engines, because the backup is taken from the standby. However, note that you may still experience elevated latencies for a few minutes during backups for Multi-AZ deployments. On instance failure in Amazon Aurora deployments, Amazon RDS uses RDS Multi-AZ technology to automate failover to one of up to 15 Amazon Aurora Replicas you have created in any of three Availability Zones. If no Amazon Aurora Replicas have been provisioned, in the case of a failure, Amazon RDS will attempt to create a new Amazon Aurora DB instance for you automatically.

Question506: You would like to create a mirror image of your production environment in another region for disaster recovery purposes. Which of the following AWS resources do not need to be recreated in the second region? (Choose two.)
 A.  Route 53 Record Sets
 B.  IM1 Roles
 C.  Elastic IP Addresses (EIP) 
 D.  EC2 Key Pairs
 E.  Launch configurations
 F.  Security Groups
answers: A. C.
Explanation: The Route 53 and IAM are global. As per the document defined, new IPs should be reserved not the same ones. Elastic IP Addresses are static IP addresses designed for dynamic cloud computing. Unlike traditional static IP addresses, however, Elastic IP addresses enable you to mask instance or Availability Zone failures by programmatically remapping your public IP addresses to instances in your account in a particular region. For DR, you can also pre-allocate some IP addresses for the most critical systems so that their IP addresses are already known before disaster strikes. This can simplify the execution of the DR plan.

Question508: A web design company currently runs several FTP servers that their 250 customers use to upload and download large graphic files They wish to move this system to AWS to make it more scalable, but they wish to maintain customer privacy and Keep costs to a minimum. What AWS architecture would you recommend?
 A.  ASK their customers to use an S3 client instead of an FTP client. Create a single S3 bucket Create an IAM  user for each customer Put the IAM Users in a Group that has an IAM policy that permits access to subdirectories within the bucket via use of the ‘username’ Policy variable.
 B.  Create a single S3 bucket with Reduced Redundancy Storage turned on and ask their customers to use an  S3 client instead of an FTP client Create a bucket for each customer with a Bucket Policy that permits  access only to that one customer.
 C.  Create an auto-scaling group of FTP servers with a scaling policy to automatically scale-in when minimum  network traffic on the auto-scaling group is below a given threshold. Load a central list of ftp users from S3  as part of the user Data startup script on each Instance. 
 D.  Create a single S3 bucket with Requester Pays turned on and ask their customers to use an S3 client  instead of an FTP client Create a bucket tor each customer with a Bucket Policy that permits access only to  that one customer.
answers: C.
Explanation: In question we have keywords `scalable’ and company wants to `move systems’ to aws, which is best suited for Auto- scaling group.

Question509: You need a persistent and durable storage to trace call activity of an IVR (Interactive Voice Response) system. Call duration is mostly in the 2-3 minutes timeframe. Each traced call can be either active or terminated. An external application needs to know each minute the list of currently active calls, which are usually a few calls/ second. Put once per month there is a periodic peak up to 1000 calls/second for a few hours. The system is open 24/7 and any downtime should be avoided. Historical data is periodically archived to files. Cost saving is a priority for this project. What database implementation would better fit this scenario, keeping costs as low as possible?
 A.  Use RDS Multi-AZ with two tables, one for -Active calls” and one for -Terminated calls”. In this way the  “Active calls_ table is always small and effective to access.
 B.  Use DynamoDB with a “Calls” table and a Global Secondary Index on a “IsActive'” attribute that is present  for active calls only In this way the Global Secondary index is sparse and more effective. 
 C.  Use DynamoDB with a ‘Calls” table and a Global secondary index on a ‘State” attribute that can equal to  “active” or “terminated” in this way the Global Secondary index can be used for all Items in the table.
 D.  Use RDS Multi-AZ with a “CALLS” table and an Indexed “STATE* field that can be equal to ‘ACTIVE” or –  TERMINATED” In this way the SOL query Is optimized by the use of the Index.
answers: B.
Explanation: Q: Can a global secondary index key be defined on non-unique attributes? Yes. Unlike the primary key on a table, a GSI index does not require the indexed attributes to be unique. Q: Are GSI key attributes required in all items of a DynamoDB table? No. GSIs are sparse indexes. Unlike the requirement of having a primary key, an item in a DynamoDB table does not have to contain any of the GSI keys. If a GSI key has both hash and range elements, and a table item omits either of them, then that item will not be indexed by the corresponding GSI. In such cases, a GSI can be very useful in efficiently locating items that have an uncommon attribute.  https://aws.amazon.com/dynamodb/faqs/

answers: B.
Explanation: The POC solution is being scaled up by 1000, which means it will require 72TB of Storage to retain 24 months’ worth of data. This rules out RDS as a possible DB solution which leaves you with RedShift. I believe DynamoDB is a more cost effective and scales better for ingest rather than using EC2 in an auto scaling group. Also, this example solution from AWS is somewhat similar for reference. http://media.amazonwebservices.com/architecturecenter/AWS_ac_ra_timeseriesprocessing_16.pdf

Question511: You have recently joined a startup company building sensors to measure street noise and air quality in urban areas. The company has been running a pilot deployment of around 100 sensors for 3 months each sensor uploads 1KB of sensor data every minute to a backend hosted on AWS. During the pilot, you measured a peak or 10 IOPS on the database, and you stored an average of 3GB of sensor data per month in the database. The current deployment consists of a load-balanced auto scaled Ingestion layer using EC2 instances and a PostgreSQL RDS database with 500GB standard storage. The pilot is considered a success and your CEO has managed to get the attention or some potential investors. The business plan requires a deployment of at least 100K sensors which needs to be supported by the backend. You also need to store sensor data for at least two years to be able to compare year over year Improvements. To secure funding, you have to make sure that the platform meets these requirements and leaves room for further scaling. Which setup win meet the requirements?
 A.  Add an SQS queue to the ingestion layer to buffer writes to the RDS instance
 B.  Ingest data into a DynamoDB table and move old data to a Redshift cluster
 C.  Replace the RDS instance with a 6 node Redshift cluster with 96TB of storage 
 D.  Keep the current architecture but upgrade RDS storage to 3TB and 10K provisioned IOPS
answers: C.


Question512: You have launched an EC2 instance with four (4) 500 GB EBS Provisioned IOPS volumes attached The EC2 Instance Is EBS-Optimized and supports 500 Mbps throughput between EC2 and EBS The two EBS volumes are configured as a single RAID o device, and each Provisioned IOPS volume is provisioned with 4.000 IOPS (4 000 16KB reads or writes) for a total of 16.000 random IOPS on the instance The EC2 Instance initially delivers the expected 16 000 IOPS random read and write performance Sometime later in order to increase the total random I/O performance of the instance, you add an additional two 500 GB EBS Provisioned IOPS volumes to the RAID Each volume Is provisioned to 4.000 IOPs like the original four for a total of 24.000 IOPS on the EC2 instance Monitoring shows that the EC2 instance CPU utilization increased from 50% to 70%. but the total random IOPS measured at the instance level does not increase at all. What is the problem and a valid solution?
 A.  Larger storage volumes support higher Provisioned IOPS rates: increase the provisioned volume storage of  each of the 6 EBS volumes to 1TB
 B.  The EBS-Optimized throughput limits the total IOPS that can be utilized use an EBS-Optimized instance  that provides larger throughput.
 C.  Small block sizes cause performance degradation, limiting the I’O throughput, configure the instance device  driver and file system to use 64KB blocks to increase throughput.
 D.  RAID 0 only scales linearly to about 4 devices, use RAID 0 with 4 EBS Provisioned IOPS volumes but  increase each Provisioned IOPS EBS volume to 6.000 IOPS.
 E.  The standard EBS instance root volume limits the total IOPS rate, change the instant root volume to also be  a 500GB 4.000 Provisioned IOPS volume.
answers: E.


Question513: Your company plans to host a large donation website on Amazon Web Services (AWS). You anticipate a large and undetermined amount of traffic that will create many database writes. To be certain that you do not drop any writes to a database hosted on AWS. Which service should you use?
 A.  Amazon RDS with provisioned IOPS up to the anticipated peak write throughput.
 B.  Amazon Simple Queue Service (SOS) for capturing the writes and draining the queue to write to the  database. 
 C.  Amazon ElastiCache to store the writes until the writes are committed to the database.
 D.  Amazon DynamoDB with provisioned write throughput up to the anticipated peak write throughput.
answers: B.
Explanation: Amazon Simple Queue Service (Amazon SQS) offers a reliable, highly scalable hosted queue for storing messages as they travel between computers. By using Amazon SQS, developers can simply move data between distributed application components performing different tasks, without losing messages or requiring each component to be always available. Amazon SQS makes it easy to build a distributed, decoupled application, working in close conjunction with the Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (Amazon EC2) and the other AWS infrastructure web services. What can I do with Amazon SQS? Amazon SQS is a web service that gives you access to a message queue that can be used to store messages while waiting for a computer to process them. This allows you to quickly build message queuing applications that can be run on any computer on the internet. Since Amazon SQS is highly scalable and you only pay for what you use, you can start small and grow your application as you wish, with no compromise on performance or reliability. This lets you focus on building sophisticated message-based applications, without worrying about how the messages are stored and managed. You can use Amazon SQS with software applications in various ways. For example, you can: Integrate Amazon SQS with other AWS infrastructure web services to make applications more reliable and flexible. Use Amazon SQS to create a queue of work where each message is a task that needs to be completed by a process. One or many computers can read tasks from the queue and perform them. Build a microservices architecture, using queues to connect your microservices. Keep notifications of significant events in a business process in an Amazon SQS queue. Each event can have a corresponding message in a queue, and applications that need to be aware of the event can read and process the messages.

Question514: Company B is launching a new game app for mobile devices. Users will log into the game using their existing social media account to streamline data capture. Company B would like to directly save player data and scoring information from the mobile app to a DynamoDS table named Score Data When a user saves their game the progress data will be stored to the Game state S3 bucket. What is the best approach for storing data to DynamoDB and S3?
 A.  Use an EC2 Instance that is launched with an EC2 role providing access to the Score Data DynamoDB  table and the GameState S3 bucket that communicates with the mobile app via web services.
 B.  Use temporary security credentials that assume a role providing access to the Score Data DynamoDB table  and the Game State S3 bucket using web identity federation. 
 C.  Use Login with Amazon allowing users to sign in with an Amazon account providing the mobile app with  access to the Score Data DynamoDB table and the Game State S3 bucket.
 D.  Use an IAM user with access credentials assigned a role providing access to the Score Data DynamoDB  table and the Game State S3 bucket for distribution with the mobile app.
answers: B.
Explanation: Web Identity Federation Imagine that you are creating a mobile app that accesses AWS resources, such as a game that runs on a mobile device and stores player and score information using Amazon S3 and DynamoDB. When you write such an app, you’ll make requests to AWS services that must be signed with an AWS access key. However, we strongly recommend that you do not embed or distribute long-term AWS credentials with apps that a user downloads to a device, even in an encrypted store. Instead, build your app so that it requests temporary AWS security credentials dynamically when needed using web identity federation. The supplied temporary credentials map to an AWS role that has only the permissions needed to perform the tasks required by the mobile app. With web identity federation, you don’t need to create custom sign-in code or manage your own user identities. Instead, users of your app can sign in using a well-known identity provider (IdP) —such as Login with Amazon, Facebook, Google, or any other OpenID Connect (OIDC)-compatible IdP, receive an authentication token, and then exchange that token for temporary security credentials in AWS that map to an IAM role with permissions to use the resources in your AWS account. Using an IdP helps you keep your AWS account secure, because you don’t have to embed and distribute long-term security credentials with your application. For most scenarios, we recommend that you use Amazon Cognito because it acts as an identity broker and does much of the federation work for you. For details, see the following section, Using Amazon Cognito for Mobile Apps. If you don’t use Amazon Cognito, then you must write code that interacts with a web IdP (Login with Amazon, Facebook, Google, or any other OIDC-compatible IdP) and then calls the AssumeRoleWithWebIdentity API to trade the authentication token you get from those IdPs for AWS temporary security credentials. If you have already used this approach for existing apps, you can continue to use it. Using Amazon Cognito for Mobile Apps The preferred way to use web identity federation is to use Amazon Cognito. For example, Adele the developer is building a game for a mobile device where user data such as scores and profiles is stored in Amazon S3 and Amazon DynamoDB. Adele could also store this data locally on the device and use Amazon Cognito to keep it synchronized across devices. She knows that for security and maintenance reasons, long-term AWS security credentials should not be distributed with the game. She also knows that the game might have a large number of users. For all of these reasons, she does not want to create new user identities in IAM for each player. Instead, she builds the game so that users can sign in using an identity that they’ve already established with awell-known identity provider, such as Login with Amazon, Facebook, Google, or any OpenID Connect (OIDC)- compatible identity provider. Her game can take advantage of the authentication mechanism from one of these providers to validate the user’s identity. To enable the mobile app to access her AWS resources, Adele first registers for a developer ID with her chosen IdPs. She also configures the application with each of these providers. In her AWS account that contains the Amazon S3 bucket and DynamoDB table for the game, Adele uses Amazon Cognito to create IAM roles that precisely define permissions that the game needs. If she is using an OIDC IdP, she also creates an IAM OIDC identity provider entity to establish trust between her AWS account and the IdP. In the app’s code, Adele calls the sign-in interface for the IdP that she configured previously. The IdP handles all the details of letting the user sign in, and the app gets an OAuth access token or OIDC ID token from the provider. Adele’s app can trade this authentication information for a set of temporary security credentials that consist of an AWS access key ID, a secret access key, and a session token. The app can then use these credentials to access web services offered by AWS. The app is limited to the permissions that are defined in the role that it assumes. The following figure shows a simplified flow for how this might work, using Login with Amazon as the IdP. For Step 2, the app can also use Facebook, Google, or any OIDC-compatible identity provider, but that’s not shown here. Sample workflow using Amazon Cognito to federate users for a mobile application
 
 A customer starts your app on a mobile device. The app asks the user to sign in. The app uses Login with Amazon resources to accept the user’s credentials. The app uses Cognito APIs to exchange the Login with Amazon ID token for a Cognito token. The app requests temporary security credentials from AWS STS, passing the Cognito token. The temporary security credentials can be used by the app to access any AWS resources required by the app to operate. The role associated with the temporary security credentials and its assigned policies determines what can be accessed. Use the following process to configure your app to use Amazon Cognito to authenticate users and give your app access to AWS resources. For specific steps to accomplish this scenario, consult the documentation for Amazon Cognito. (Optional) Sign up as a developer with Login with Amazon, Facebook, Google, or any other OpenID Connect (OIDC)–compatible identity provider and configure one or more apps with the provider. This step is optional because Amazon Cognito also supports unauthenticated (guest) access for your users. Go to Amazon Cognito in the AWS Management Console. Use the Amazon Cognito wizard to create an identity pool, which is a container that Amazon Cognito uses to keep end user identities organized for your apps. You can share identity pools between apps. When you set up an identity pool, Amazon Cognito creates one or two IAM roles (one for authenticated identities, and one for unauthenticated “guest” identities) that define permissions for Amazon Cognito users. Download and integrate the AWS SDK for iOS or the AWS SDK for Android with your app, and import the files required to use Amazon Cognito. Create an instance of the Amazon Cognito credentials provider, passing the identity pool ID, your AWS account number, and the Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the roles that you associated with the identity pool. TheAmazon Cognito wizard in the AWS Management Console provides sample code to help you get started. When your app accesses an AWS resource, pass the credentials provider instance to the client object, which passes temporary security credentials to the client. The permissions for the credentials are based on the role or roles that you defined earlier.

Question515: A customer has a 10 GB AWS Direct Connect connection to an AWS region where they have a web application hosted on Amazon Elastic Computer Cloud (EC2). The application has dependencies on an on-premises mainframe database that uses a BASE (Basic Available. Sort stale Eventual consistency) rather than an ACID (Atomicity. Consistency isolation. Durability) consistency model. The application is exhibiting undesirable behavior because the database is not able to handle the volume of writes. How can you reduce the load on your on-premises database resources in the most cost-effective way?
 A.  Use an Amazon Elastic Map Reduce (EMR) S3DistCp as a synchronization mechanism between the onpremises database and a Hadoop cluster on AWS.
 B.  Modify the application to write to an Amazon SQS queue and develop a worker process to flush the queue  to the on-premises database.
 C.  Modify the application to use DynamoDB to feed an EMR cluster which uses a map function to write to the  on-premises database.
 D.  Provision an RDS read-replica database on AWS to handle the writes and synchronize the two databases  using Data Pipeline.
answers: A.

answers: A.


Question517: Your customer wishes to deploy an enterprise application to AWS which will consist of several web servers, several application servers and a small (50GB) Oracle database information is stored, both in the database and the file systems of the various servers. The backup system must support database recovery whole server and whole disk restores, and individual file restores with a recovery time of no more than two hours. They have chosen to use RDS Oracle as the database. Which backup architecture will meet these requirements?
 A.  Backup RDS using automated daily DB backups Backup the EC2 instances using AMIs and supplement  with file-level backup to S3 using traditional enterprise backup software to provide file level restore
 B.  Backup RDS using a Multi-AZ Deployment Backup the EC2 instances using Amis, and supplement by  copying file system data to S3 to provide file level restore.
 C.  Backup RDS using automated daily DB backups Backup the EC2 instances using EBS snapshots and  supplement with file-level backups to Amazon Glacier using traditional enterprise backup software to  provide file level restore
 D.  Backup RDS database to S3 using Oracle RMAN Backup the EC2 instances using Amis, and supplement  with EBS snapshots for individual volume restore.
answers: A.
Explanation: Point-In-Time Recovery In addition to the daily automated backup, Amazon RDS archives database change logs. This enables you to recover your database to any point in time during the backup retention period, up to the last five minutes of database usage. Amazon RDS stores multiple copies of your data, but for Single-AZ DB instances these copies are stored in a single availability zone. If for any reason a Single-AZ DB instance becomes unusable, you can use point-in-time recovery to launch a new DB instance with the latest restorable data. For more information on working with point-in-time recovery, go to Restoring a DB Instance to a Specified Time. Note Multi-AZ deployments store copies of your data in different Availability Zones for greater levels of data durability. For more information on Multi-AZ deployments, see High Availability (Multi-AZ).

Question518: A 3-tier e-commerce web application is current deployed on-premises and will be migrated to AWS for greater scalability and elasticity The web server currently shares read-only data using a network distributed file system The app server tier uses a clustering mechanism for discovery and shared session state that depends on IP multicast The database tier uses shared-storage clustering to provide database fall over capability, and uses several read slaves for scaling Data on all servers and the distributed file system directory is backed up weekly to off-site tapes Which AWS storage and database architecture meets the requirements of the application?
 A.  Web servers: store read-only data in S3, and copy from S3 to root volume at boot time. App servers: share  state using a combination of DynamoDB and IP unicast. Database: use RDS with multi-AZ deployment and  one or more read replicas. Backup: web servers, app servers, and database backed up weekly to Glacier  using snapshots.

 C.  Web servers: store read-only data in S3, and copy from S3 to root volume at boot time. App servers: share  state using a combination of DynamoDB and IP unicast. Database: use RDS with multi-AZ deployment and  one or more Read Replicas. Backup: web and app servers backed up weekly via AMIs, database backed  up via DB snapshots. 
 D.  Web servers: store read-only data in S3, and copy from S3 to root volume at boot time. App servers: share  state using a combination of DynamoDB and IP unicast. Database: use RDS with multi-AZ deployment.  Backup: web and app servers backed up weekly via AMIs, database backed up via DB snapshots.
answers: C.
Explanation: Amazon RDS Multi-AZ deployments provide enhanced availability and durability for Database (DB) Instances, making them a natural fit for production database workloads. When you provision a Multi-AZ DB Instance, Amazon RDS automatically creates a primary DB Instance and synchronously replicates the data to a standby instance in a different Availability Zone (AZ). Each AZ runs on its own physically distinct, independent infrastructure, and is engineered to be highly reliable. In case of an infrastructure failure (for example, instance hardware failure, storage failure, or network disruption), Amazon RDS performs an automatic failover to the standby, so that you can resume database operations as soon as the failover is complete. Since the endpoint for your DB Instance remains the same after a failover, your application can resume database operation without the need for manual administrative intervention. Benefits Enhanced Durability Multi-AZ deployments for the MySQL, Oracle, and PostgreSQL engines utilize synchronous physical replication to keep data on the standby up-to-date with the primary. Multi-AZ deployments for the SQL Server engine use synchronous logical replication to achieve the same result, employing SQL Server-native Mirroring technology. Both approaches safeguard your data in the event of a DB Instance failure or loss of an Availability Zone. If a storage volume on your primary fails in a Multi-AZ deployment, Amazon RDS automatically initiates a failover to the up-to-date standby. Compare this to a Single-AZ deployment: in case of a Single-AZ database failure, a user-initiated point-in-time-restore operation will be required. This operation can take several hours to complete, and any data updates that occurred after the latest restorable time (typically within the last five minutes) will not be available. Amazon Aurora employs a highly durable, SSD-backed virtualized storage layer purpose-built for database workloads. Amazon Aurora automatically replicates your volume six ways, across three Availability Zones. Amazon Aurora storage is fault-tolerant, transparently handling the loss of up to two copies of data without affecting database write availability and up to three copies without affecting read availability. Amazon Aurora storage is also self-healing. Data blocks and disks are continuously scanned for errors and replaced automatically.Increased Availability You also benefit from enhanced database availability when running Multi-AZ deployments. If an Availability Zone failure or DB Instance failure occurs, your availability impact is limited to the time automatic failover takes to complete: typically under one minute for Amazon Aurora and one to two minutes for other database engines (see the RDS FAQ for details). The availability benefits of Multi-AZ deployments also extend to planned maintenance and backups. In the case of system upgrades like OS patching or DB Instance scaling, these operations are applied first on the standby, prior to the automatic failover. As a result, your availability impact is, again, only the time required for automatic failover to complete. Unlike Single-AZ deployments, I/O activity is not suspended on your primary during backup for Multi-AZ deployments for the MySQL, Oracle, and PostgreSQL engines, because the backup is taken from the standby. However, note that you may still experience elevated latencies for a few minutes during backups for Multi-AZ deployments. On instance failure in Amazon Aurora deployments, Amazon RDS uses RDS Multi-AZ technology to automate failover to one of up to 15 Amazon Aurora Replicas you have created in any of three Availability Zones. If no Amazon Aurora Replicas have been provisioned, in the case of a failure, Amazon RDS will attempt to create a new Amazon Aurora DB instance for you automatically. No Administrative Intervention DB Instance failover is fully automatic and requires no administrative intervention. Amazon RDS monitors the health of your primary and standbys, and initiates a failover automatically in response to a variety of failure conditions. Failover conditions Amazon RDS detects and automatically recovers from the most common failure scenarios for Multi-AZ deployments so that you can resume database operations as quickly as possible without administrative intervention. Amazon RDS automatically performs a failover in the event of any of the following: Loss of availability in primary Availability Zone Loss of network connectivity to primary Compute unit failure on primary Storage failure on primary Note: When operations such as DB Instance scaling or system upgrades like OS patching are initiated for MultiAZ deployments, for enhanced availability, they are applied first on the standby prior to an automatic failover. As a result, your availability impact is limited only to the time required for automatic failover to complete. Note that Amazon RDS Multi-AZ deployments do not failover automatically in response to database operations such as long running queries, deadlocks or database corruption errors.
